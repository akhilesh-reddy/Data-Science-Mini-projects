## Association rules
### Introduction
Association rule mining is a very interesting and important topic in retail analytics.Being able to find the associations between various products or services is the first step towards providing personalized recommendations.In this problem, i have tried my hand at finding the association rules between the different grocery items in the cart and visualizing the result in a user-friendly way.

### Technologies
Rstudio 1.1.453
Gephi

### Algorithms
Apriori algorithm

### Approach
Steps followed to create the association rules

1.Data pre processing
2.Running the apriori algorithm
3.Visualization of the Output
