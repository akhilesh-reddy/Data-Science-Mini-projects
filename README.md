# Data science and Machine learning mini projects
This repository contains all my personal projects and mini projects/assignments that are part of curicullum at UT Austin.
As there are multiple projects in this repository, i have created readme documents for each project separately. Here you can find the introduction to each of those projects. For more detail, please look into the respective project folder

## Association rules
Association rule mining is a very interesting and important topic in retail analytics.Being able to find the associations between various products or services is the first step towards providing personalized recommendations.In this problem, i have tried my hand at finding the association rules between the different grocery items in the cart and visualizing the result in a user-friendly way.

## Author attribution
Author attribution is one of the interesting applications of text analytics. In this exercise, i have tried to attribute the articles to various authors using different text pre-processing techniques and compared the performance of various classification models on the final dataset.  

## Market segmentation  
Market Segmentation has always been the first step in any product launch, campaign or personalized recommendation. This was data collected in the course of a market-research study using followers of the Twitter account of a large consumer brand that shall remain nameless---let's call it "NutrientH20" just to have a label. The goal here was for NutrientH20 to understand its social-media audience a little bit better, so that it could hone its messaging a little more sharply.  

## Prediction of vehicle testing time  
Predicting the test time for Mercedes benz cars after manufacturing was the main objective of this project. Using XGBoost, we achieved an R squared value of ~55% for the prediction model.  

## Web scraping and analysis of car reviews  
Understanding how customers are associating a brand with their own sentiments is crucial information to growth in industries. In this mini project, we have found associations between luxury cars discussed in Edmundâ€™s forum and generated insights regarding what attributes are customers talking about when it comes to these brands
