## Association rules
### Introduction
Association rule mining is a very interesting and important topic in retail analytics.Being able to find the associations between various products or services is the first step towards providing personalized recommendations.In this problem, i have tried my hand at finding the association rules between the different grocery items in the cart and visualizing the result in a user-friendly way.

### Technologies
Rstudio 1.1.453  
Gephi  

### Algorithms
Apriori algorithm

### Approach
Steps followed to create the association rules

1.Data pre-processing  
2.Running the apriori algorithm  
3.Visualization of the Output  

## Author attribution
### Introduction
Author attribution is one of the interesting applications of text analytics. In this exercise, i have tried to attribute the articles to various authors using different text pre-processing techniques and compared the performance of various classification models on the final dataset.  

### Technologies  
Rstudio 1.1.453  

### Algorithms  
* K nearest neighbors  
* Random forest  
* XGboost  
* SVM  

### Approach  
1.Read the data in suitable formats required for the exercise  
2.Perform all the pre-processing tasks on the dataset extracted like removing stop words, changing to lower case e.t.c  
3.Create the TF-IDF matrix for both train and test data  
4.Dimensionality reduction  
5.Use the TF-IDF data to create models and compare the accuracy across models to identify the author of a particular article  

## Market segmentation
### Introduction
Market Segmentation has always been the first step in any product launch, campaign or personalized recommendation. This was data collected in the course of a market-research study using followers of the Twitter account of a large consumer brand that shall remain nameless---let's call it "NutrientH20" just to have a label. The goal here was for NutrientH20 to understand its social-media audience a little bit better, so that it could hone its messaging a little more sharply.  

### Technologies  
Rstudio 1.1.453  

### Algorithms  
* k-means clustering  

### Approach  
1.Explore the data for correlated audience interests  
2.Normalize the data and perform clustering  
3.Profile the clusters after k-means clustering
