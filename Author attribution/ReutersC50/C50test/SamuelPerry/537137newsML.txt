Internet software company Netscape Communications Corp. Wednesday reported a 119 percent surge in first-quarter profits to $7.9 million, boosted by new business on its Web site and corporate sales growth.
Chief Executive Officer Jim Barksdale said in a statement the company's server -- or network host computer software -- business continued to grow, accounting for roughly 38 percent of the company's revenues for the quarter.
Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape's earnings, equal to 9 cents a share, compared with $3.6 million, or 4 cents a share in the first quarter of 1996.
Revenues totalled $120.2 million, a 114 percent increase over the $56.1 million in revenues generated a year ago. Industry analysts on average had expected Netscape to post earnings of 8 cents a share.
Netscape reported growth in revenues from new businesses that will attract viewers to its Web site for informaiton as well as products, including a deal with Yahoo! Inc. to provide an Internet information navigation service.
That deal was among the factors that helped boost services to 25 percent of revenues from 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Currie said services and the Web site were important financial contributors.
The earnings were released after the market close.
