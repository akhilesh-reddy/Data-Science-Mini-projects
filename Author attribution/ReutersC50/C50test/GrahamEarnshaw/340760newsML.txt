Shanghai's economy, which grew a phenomenal 13 percent last year, is likely to see only slightly slower growth in 1997, but unemployment in China's largest city is rising, the city's statistics bureau announced on Wednesday.
Shanghai's gross domestic product growth rate is likely to stabilise and fall gradually in the next few years, the statistics bureau's director Sun Zuyao told a news conference.
"The GDP growth rate for Shanghai in 1997 is likely to differ from that of 1996 by around one percentage point, and from current conditions, it would appear more likely to be down rather than up," Sun said.
"Shanghai's economy has been growing at more than 14 percent a year since 1992. That's fast enough," he added. "Of course, if everyone does good work, then we could see an increase."
Previously published figures give Shanghai's GDP for 1996 at 287 billion yuan, a rise of 13 percent on 1995.
Sun said one of the biggest problems facing the city was how to deal with the large number of loss-making state-owned enterprises and the staff who are forced out of their jobs with only a subsistance allowance.
He said the number of Shanghai's unemployed workers, including the so-called "xiagang" staff (staff withdrawn from their posts) from state enterprises, rose 20 percent during 1996.
Sun said the number of people in the city registered as unemployed with no connection to any work unit was 150,000 at the end of 1996, about the same as at the end of 1995.
But he said the number of "xiagang" workers had risen to 270,000 by the end of 1996, up from 200,000 at the end of 1995.
Analysts say China's communist government forces the heavily indebted state enterprises to keep most of their workers on their books, fearing the social consequences of sudden and massive unemployment.
But Sun said there had been an improvement in the overall situation with the state enterprises in Shanghai, which are the target of continuing gradual pressure to improve their operations or else merge or close.
About 27.8 percent of state enterprises in Shanghai lost money last year, down from 33 percent in 1995, with losses last year amounting to 5.7 billion yuan, or about 27 percent of the total profits of Shanghai's industrial enterprises.
"Due to the ongoing reforms of the state enterprise sector, I think there will be a relatively good improvement in the situation with regard to loss-making state enterprises this year," he said.
The statistics issued by the bureau on Wednesday highlighted the changes taking place within Shanghai's economy, particularly in the textile sector that was once the powerhouse of the city's industry.
Output of cloth in 1996 fell by 43.4 percent to 341 million metres and yarn output fell 25.1 percent to 191,000 tonnes.
