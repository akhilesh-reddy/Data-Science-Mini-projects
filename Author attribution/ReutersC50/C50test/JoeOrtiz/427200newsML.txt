Financial services group Cater Allen said on Friday its purchase of Glasgow-based stockbroker Aitken Campbell from Union Plc would complement its existing activities in share dealing and stock lending.
"We already have a number of allied operations like City Deal and in Cater Allen we have a significant stock lending operation," Cater's managing director David White said in an interview.
White declined to divulge the price of Aitken Campbell but said the amount was not significant and that, while contracts remained to be signed, both sides had sought to reassure both the market and Aitken staff by making an announcement.
"Aitken fits in quite nicely with City Deal and will be a sister company, we're not merging it into anything," White added.
He also noted one of the attractions of Aitken Campbell was that it runs one of only four electronic trading systems in the market -- the others belong to BZW, Kleinwort Benson and Merrill Lynch.
Cater still maintains its discount house and other money market activities and has also moved into fund management.
Union announced on February 25 that it was at an advanced stage in talks to sell Aitken Campbell as part of a major reorganisation, which saw the historic firm give up its role as a money market counterparty to the Bank of England.
Union is thought to have received a bid approach for the rest of the company, mainly an asset play based on its banking licence and desirable headquarters building in the heart of the City, from millionaire Joe Lewis who already owns 24 percent of Union.
Caribbean-based Lewis recently hit the headlines by investing 40 million stg in football club Glasgow Rangers.
Acting executive chairman of Union, Graeme Knox was not available for comment on reports that Lewis's English National Investment Company is offering a 110p cash and shares deal for Union whose shares currently stand at 96p.
