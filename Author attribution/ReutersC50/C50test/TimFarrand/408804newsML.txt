British oil exploration company LASMO Plc expects oil prices to weaken in the short term but Brent crude should average $19 for the year, chief executive Joe Darby said in an interview.
"We think prices are going to weaken in the short term, but we don't think they are going to fall through the floor, the floor being around $15 or $16 a barrel," said Darby
"We are planning on $19 average for the year on Brent." LASMO realised an average $18.72 per barrel in 1996, up from $17.09 in 1995.
