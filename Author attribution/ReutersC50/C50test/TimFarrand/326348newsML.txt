Scottish-based Stakis Plc on Wednesday reported a surge in visitors to its casinos and a sharp rise in its hotel room rates, with chief executive David Michel in confident mood about future trends.
"In real terms we are just back to where room rates were in the late 1980s. Room rates have just about reached their pre-recession levels in the provinces," Michels told Reuters.
The company's hotels, excluding the Metropole in London acquired in November for 327 million stg ($543 million) from Lonrho, showed an occupancy level of 71.8 percent in the first 13 weeks of 1997, a touch down from 72 percent last time.
But its average room rate rose to 50.10 stg over the same period, up from 45.58 in 1996.
"In the first quarter we did 10 percent, but I still think the average will be 7.5 percent or more over the year," said Michels. "Our forecast is to finish this year at 76 percent occupancy," he added.
Although January was a typically dull month for hotel occupancy, future bookings are at similar levels to last year, giving every confidence Stakis can achieve its target, he said.
The group's hotel occupancy was also pulled back slightly in the period by the temporary closure of the Stakis Tyneside where work is underway on a 3.5 million stg refurbishment.
During the six weeks Metropole traded under the Stakis flag, it showed 64.7 percent occupancy at an average price per room of 64.77 stg for its 2,266 rooms.
In a trading statement, Stakis said attendance at its 23 casinos rose to 603,000 in the quarter up from 525,000, but the spend per head fell to 110 stg from 129 .
Turnover at the casinos rose 20 percent to 14.2 million stg driven by the 17 percent increase in attendances.
The fall in spend per head mainly reflected the sale of the Barracuda casino in April last year to Ladbroke, said Michel. The spend per head at the Barracuda averaged 450 stg.
But Michel was encouraged by the increased casino attendance. "More people realise that they are a reasonable night out, you don't have to spend 100 stg," he said.
"We have spent a year trying to make them do so, we've made a number of conversions, one big new build, and promotions to our base membership of 900,000, and we have introduced new training tables."
The improvements coincided with an increase in newspaper and television interest in casinos.
Stakis shares were up 1-1/2p at 103p in early trade. ($1=.6021 Pound)
