Cider maker Matthew Clark has put a line under the extent of its losses inflicted mainly by the phenomenal growth of "alcopops" and now has a strategy that will turn the company round, said its business development director.
"The numbers we have put into the market today and the issues we have identified, that is all the issues and that is the financial costs of those issues in this whole year," said Peter Huntley in an interview. Clark estimated its losses at 22 million for the year from a combination of lower sales and tougher competition over pricing and supply contracts.
