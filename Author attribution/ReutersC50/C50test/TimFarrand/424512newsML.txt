British food manufacturer Hillsdown Holdings plc on Thursday reported a 10.5 percent increase in its 1996 pretax profits to 150.5 million pounds ($242.7 million) and said the business climate in 1997 looked good.
"The year has only just begun for Hillsdown but the business climate in 1997 looks favourable," Chairman Sir John Nott said.
The scare over mad cow disease -- bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- continued to dent Hillsdown's meat business but it helped lift its poultry and fish sales.
Trading profit on canning, preserves, biscuits and drinks rose to 63.6 million pounds in 1996 from 40.5 million, although earnings from chilled foods were flat at 21.2 million.
Profits from the company's meat and produce division fell to 9.1 million from 12.4 million in 1995 but the poultry, furniture and housebuilding division boosted profits from 36.2 million to 46.8 million.
Earnings from Britain rose by some 35 million to 146.5 million but in mainland Europe trading profits were flat at about 30 million, reflecting the poor state of the German economy.
"The red meat market has continued to be lifeless and our international meat traders, Towers, have effectively had to tread water with the emphasis on tight stock control," said chief executive George Greener in a statement.
Fairview New Homes, which had a strong second half and has doubled its land bank over the last two years, is set for strong profits performance as confidence in the housing recovery grows, he said.
Greener scotched some hopes in financial markets that the group would dispose of its non-food interests.
He said the structure and culture of Hillsdown as a diversified manufacturing company is a major strength and should be enhanced.
"I do not believe it is simply a question of divesting of highly profitable non-food businesses," said Greener.
Hillsdown shares were two pence higher at 193-1/2 pence in the morning session, as the company's headline profits topped brokers' consensus forecast of 149 million pounds. ($ = 0.620 British Pounds)
