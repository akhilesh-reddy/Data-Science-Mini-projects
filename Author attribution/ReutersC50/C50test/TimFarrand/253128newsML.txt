Pub-to-hotels group Greenalls Plc is seeing a strong level of Christmas bookings and consumer confidence is picking up, managing director Peter Daresbury said in an interview.
"Christmas bookings are looking very good and there seems to be a strong level of consumer confidence, although the snow and the fog has not been wonderful for the business," he said.
Christmas is a critical period for hotel, pub and restaurant companies operating in Britain and mainland Europe with as much as 20 percent of their annual turnover generated in December.  
Greenalls, owners of the 21-strong De Vere Hotels chain, 2,360 pubs and 470 off-licenses, earlier reported a 47.9 percent rise in pre-tax, pre-exceptional profits to 148.7 million in the year ended September 27. Greenalls has seen improved hotel occupancy and conference business as the corporate sector turned more buoyant and people took more leisure breaks in the year, said Daresbury.
De Vere Hotels revenue per available room rose 10.8 percent and occupancy levels were up at 74.4 percent from 72.6 percent.
The company's chain of 46 Premier Lodge's increased occupancy levels from 72 percent to 73 percent with revenue per available room up 9.1 percent during the year.
"We think that we are seeing a sort of steady pick up in consumer confidence and we consider that to be sustainable for 12 to 18 months," said Daresbury.
Greenalls is also investing to attract the non-traditional pub goer who wants to eat out and is prepared to trade up by buying wine or premium lagers for instance rather than cheaper ales, he said.
This strategy should give the company more exposure at the top end of its pub estate to improvements in consumer spending, said Daresbury.
The company plans to extend its pub concepts into 292 of its managed estate over the next year and aims to build 10 to 15 new large city-centre pubs.
It announced plans to spend 170 million on developing its business in 1997/98 with about 40 million going on rolling out its Greenalls pub concepts.
Greenalls Inns now operates 920 outlets nationally, of which 514 are managed food houses. Drinks and food sales per outlet in its enlarged managed pub estate, rose 7.8 percent and 11.9 percent respectively.
Greenalls Inns pub estate was greatly expanded by the acquisition of Boddington in November for 527 million stg.
Operating margins at Greenalls Inns managed estate were up 1.1 percentage points at 25.7 percent, which reflected changes in the mix of drinks on offer with more wine, premium lager and soft drinks on sale.
The company's branded pub restaurants and lodges saw food and drink sales per outlet up by 14.6 percent and 13.8 percent respectively.
Greenalls' Premier House operates 175 outlets in Britain, including 88 Millers Kitchens, 41 Henry's Tables, 13 Henry's Cafe Bars and seven Quinceys.
Analysts expect Greenalls to turn in pre-tax profits of about 168-170 million stg in 1997/98.
