British pub-to-hotel group Greenalls Plc on Thursday reported a 48 percent rise in profits before exceptional items to 148.7 million pounds ($246.4 million), driven by its acquisition of brewer Boddington in November 1995.
"The year saw a good trading performance, both from the Greenalls businesses and the former Boddington estate," said chairman and chief executive Andrew Thomas. "Trading in the current year has begun satisfactorily," he added.
Exceptional items charged in the year ended September 27, 1996, totalled 31.2 million, including 23.9 million for paying redundancy to former Boddington staff and re-organisation costs.
Underlying profit before exceptional items and tax and excluding Boddington increased by 10.7 percent to 111.3 million.
Boddington generated operating profit of 47.1 million in the 11 months after it was acquired and Greenalls said it saved 18 million in costs from integrating Boddington into the group.
Overall group profits before tax and exceptional items were at the top end of share analysts' forecasts, which ranged from 145 to 150 million pounds.
However, Greenalls shares fell 7p to 597p after the company ruled out the sale of its De Vere Hotels.
"I suspect one of the reasons why the stock has come off is that they ruled out selling off their De Vere brand at this stage. But we still remain positive on the stock because we see growth across all the businesses in a consumer led 1997," said James Wheatcroft an analyst at Panmure Gordon in London.
In an interview Greenalls managing director Peter Daresbury said the company's outlook for the Christmas period was good.
"Christmas bookings are looking very good and there seems to be a strong level of consumer confidence, although the snow and the fog has not been wonderful for the business," he said.
Christmas is a critical period for hotel, pub and restaurant groups in Britain and mainland Europe with as much as 20 percent of their annual turnover generated in December alone.
The company plans to spend 170 million on developing its business in 1997/98 with about 40 million going on rolling out its Greenalls pub concepts.
Profits from Greenalls Inns rose 50.2 percent to 78.9 million when Boddington is included. Greenalls Inns operates 920 outlets nationally, of which 514 are managed food houses.
Greenalls branded pub restaurants and lodges -- which include 88 so-called Millers Kitchens and 41 Henry's Tables -- improved profits by 41.8 percent to 24.8 million. De Vere Hotels lifted operating profit by 14.5 percent to 25.2 million as revenue per available room and occupancy levels rose.
