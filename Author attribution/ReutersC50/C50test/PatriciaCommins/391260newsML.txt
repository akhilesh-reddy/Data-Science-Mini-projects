Wm. Wrigley Jr Co said Thursday it is looking for ways to help revitalize the domestic chewing gum market, which saw about a one percent drop in physical sales volume in 1996.
"We have to bring new news to the category...either in advertising, merchandising (or) improved products," William Piet, vice president of corporate affairs and corporate secretary, said in an interview after a presentation at an analysts' conference here.  
Piet cautioned that last year's decline in the overall domestic chewing gum market does not signal "a disaster," adding that the industry has been growing at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent.
"It's a knock on the door," Piet said of the decline.
Despite the decline in the domestic market, Wrigley's chewing gum brands at the end of 1996 surpassed about a 50 percent market share, up a little more than one point.  
North America accounts for roughly 46 percent of Wrigley's business, but Wrigley continues to grow overseas. This year it will add Cambodia to the list of some 120 countries where it sells products. Cambodia will be supplied out of a new replacement factory in the Philippines, along with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
Wrigley also plans to begin construction this spring for a new factory in Russia. That plant, which was previously announced, is expected to be in operation in early 1999.
With the Russia facility, Wrigley will have plants in 13 countries outside the United States.
Piet said growth in the international market varies from year to year, but said over 10 years the growth rate has been about four times that of the domestic market.
