Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc, which set records for sales, profit and beer volume in 1996, said Wednesday it continues to aim for a double-digit percentage increase in its earnings per share in 1997.
"Our projection for this year is double-digits...EPS growth," W. Randolph "Randy" Baker, chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview.
Anheuser, which brews Budweiser and Michelob beer, earned $2.21 a share from continuing operations in 1996, up 11 percent from $1.99 in 1995, both before extraordinary items.  
For the fourth quarter, it earned $0.30 a share, in line with analysts' expectations, compared with earnings from continuing operations, and excluding charges, of $0.27 a share in the 1995 fourth quarter. The year-ago fourth quarter results exclude $160.0 million in costs for closing a Tampa, Fla., brewery and $74.5 million in costs for wholesale inventory reductions.
"As we end 1996 and begin 1997, we do so in a position of great competitive strength and we have set the stage for significant long-term earnings growth for 1997," Baker said.  
Gross sales for 1996, before excise taxes, were a record $12.6 billion in 1996, up four percent from 1995.
Anheuser said it sold a record 91.1 million barrels of beer in 1996, up 4.1 percent from 1995. Adjusting for an inventory reduction in 1995, beer volume grew 2.8 percent.
The company also boosted its leading domestic market share in 1996 by 1.1 points to 45.2 percent.
"The volume growth remains very, very good," Oppenheimer and Co analyst Roy Burry said. "That's the problem."
With Anheuser being the only U.S. major brewer to gain market share, competition has intensified, Burry said.  
In spite of the increased competition, Baker said Anheuser implemented about a three percent price increase, equal to $0.10 to $0.15 per six-pack of beer, in much of the United States this month. This followed a similar price increase in seven states in September and October of 1996.
He said it is too soon to tell if the price increases are holding. But preliminary reports indicate Anheuser's major competitors are following the price move on their premium brands in a majority of markets, he added.
Internationally, Anheuser reaped a double-digit increase in sales volume in 1996, Baker said, continuing a trend for this business.
International brewing profit dropped slightly in 1996 compared to 1995, due in part to increased marketing expenses.
Anheuser has been building its overseas beer business with ventures and investments in foreign brewers. In December, it increased its ownership in Grupo Modelo SA de CV to 37 percent for an investment of about $550 million.
The company said its Busch Entertainment theme park subsidiary made a significant contribution to earnings in 1996, with its fifth consecutive year of record attendance and profitability.
