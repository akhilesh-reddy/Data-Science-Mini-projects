Interstate Bakeries Corp chairman Charles Sullivan said Thursday he backs analysts' earnings estimates of $0.35-$0.40 a share for the company's third quarter. (Corrects timeframe from fiscal 1997)
"We told them (analysts) we're not uncomfortable with that," Sullivan said in an interview here after a presentation at an analysts' conference.  
In the year ago third quarter, the company earned $0.11 a share.
Sullivan said the anticipated growth in third quarter earnings reflects reduced costs, higher revenues and increased sales of branded products.
Interstate, the largest baker and distributor of fresh bakery products in the United States has brands including Wonder, Hostess and Dolly Madison.  
Moving forward, Interstate said it plans to extend those brand lines with new products, seeking to appeal to children with offerings like bubble gum flavored mini muffins and to adults with improved low fat Hostess Twinkies.
Interstate also began rolling out last month a fat-free Wonder bread, which it expects will appeal to an older consumer.
The company is also looking to extend its reach in the United States, looking for acquisitions in a consolidating industry.
Sullivan said Interstate plans to acquire an existing bakery operation, west of the Mississippi River. He would provide no other details.
That deal would help offset lost revenue from government-ordered divestitures after Interstate's 1995 purchase of Continental Baking Co, he said.
