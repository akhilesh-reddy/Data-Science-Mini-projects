China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday dismissed British opposition to Beijing's plans to disband Hong Kong's legislature and said it would not affect the smooth transfer of power in the territory this year.
"The British side's opposition to this is an overreaction and unreasonable and unnecessary," Qian told reporters.
"... if they (British authorities) continue to voice their opposition to the operation of the provisional Legislative Council I don't think it will have any impact on the smooth transition of Hong Kong," he said.
Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, becoming a Special Administrative Region of China after 150 years of British rule.
Beijing has pledged to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the transfer of power.
China has said it will scrap Hong Kong's existing elected Legislative Council and install an appointed provisional body in a move opposed by Britain as well as the United States.
Qian, who is also a vice-premier, conceded that foreign countries had commercial interests in Hong Kong but that did not give them the right to inferfere in the territory's affairs after the handover.
"No foreign country has the right to interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," he said, repeating Beijing's long-standing position.
Qian also held out the prospect of legislators who lost seats in Hong Kong being able to run for posts in China's parliament, the National People's Congress.
He said, however, they would have to recognise the Chinese constitution and accept China's procedures for choosing delegates.
China's parliament has little real power and its main task is to approve laws drafted by the Communist Party.
It has nearly 3,000 delegates and Hong Kong will be entitled to only 36 of those seats next year.
