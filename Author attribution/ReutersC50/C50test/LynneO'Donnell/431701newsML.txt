Sky-high world copper prices do not seem to be supported by fundamentals and could soon be in for a liquidation-related correction, Chinese copper trading sources said on Monday.
"I don't really see any support for $2,400," a Chinese source on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) said.
"If the price can go above $2,400 a tonne and stay up there for a decent period, that would indicate some support," he said. "But I think the funds are under pressure to sell."
London Metal Exchange (LME) copper came under heavy pressure from liquidation and end-week sales on Friday after surging to a nine-month high of $2,445 a tonne.
The market fell back to close Friday's kerb at $2,390, a $13 fall on Thursday's close.
Shanghai copper futures ended down across the board on Monday on heavy profit-taking, with the most active June 1997 contract ending at 23,370 yuan ($2,817), losing 50 yuan.
Traders said the correction came on the back of the LME's Friday falls.
The SME trading source said he would sell at 23,300 yuan per tonne. Monday's intra-day low was 23,200 yuan and he saw it going down further this week to 22,800.
LME copper appeared set to test the downside on Monday, with the first support level at $2,350, London analysts said.
This had the support of Chinese traders, one of whom said from the southern Zhuhai Special Economic Zone that LME copper prices should consolidate around $2,320-2,380.
He and others ruled out Chinese activity in the immediate term, saying prices were still too high to justify buying.
The official China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday that China's demand for copper would reach 1.2 million tonnes in 1997.
China's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes, up 5.71 percent on 1995, according to State Statistical Bureau figures.
Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.
Copper imports are expected to remain high, media reports have said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-8544
