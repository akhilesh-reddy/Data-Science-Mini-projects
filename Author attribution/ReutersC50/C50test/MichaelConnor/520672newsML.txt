The judge overseeing the state of Florida's lawsuit against tobacco companies on Friday ordered the release of eight documents handed over by Liggett Group for use against other cigarette makers.
West Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge Harold Cohen ordered the documents kept sealed until a ruling by a higher court on an expected appeal. The papers contain evidence of tobacco-industry fraud, according to a retired judge who reviewed them. .  
The eight documents are largely notes from meetings among tobacco company lawyers planning defenses against liability lawsuits in past decades.
They are among documents Liggett Group, a unit of Brooke Group, agreed to turn over to state attorneys general as part of a settlement announced on March 20 to shelter Liggett from liability claims.
Attorneys for Philip Morris Cos and other tobacco companies argued that William Rutter, the retired judge appointed by Cohen to review 20 Liggett documents, had made procedural mistakes.  
The tobacco industry lawyers also argued Rutter had asked too little proof from the Florida state lawyers before overriding client-attorney shelter usually given such papers and that there was meager evidence of industry fraud.
Cohen rejected all the arguments and asked that any appeals be quickly handled by a higher court since he was intent on going ahead with an August trial.
Stephen Krigbaum, an attorney in West Palm Beach, Florida, for Philip Morris, said an appeal of Cohen's decision would be made quickly.
"We think it is wrong on the facts and wrong on the law," Krigbaum said.
Cohen also said secret talks involving tobacco companies and attorneys generals on a sweeping settlement of outstanding cigarette litigation would not delay the trial.
"It should be clear to all parties, counsel, and the appellate court that alleged 'secret settlement negotiations' will have absolutely no effect on the commencement of trial in this case ...,"  he wrote.
