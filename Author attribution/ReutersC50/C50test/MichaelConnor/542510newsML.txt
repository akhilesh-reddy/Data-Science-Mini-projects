Quickly expanding Republic Industries should meet full-year 1997 share-profit estimates of $0.70, Republic chief financial officer Mike Karsher said on Monday.
All four Republic segments, including car retailing, performed well in the first quarter and the diversified services group expects to accelerate the pace of openings of its AutoNation used-car superstores in 1997, Karsher told Reuters.  
But Karsher cautioned the four or five new superstores being added to the 1997 schedule would not add to 1997 full-year profits since the outlets typically incur initial losses until sales volume picks up.
Republic is on an acquisition campaign. In the past six months it bought major car-rental agencies such as Alamo and car dealerships in many parts of the United States.
For the first quarter, Republic reported a doubling of share profits to $0.08 from the same period in 1996.
Karsher said the share profits were $0.01 higher than a consensus of Wall Street analysts forecasts.  
Net income grew even faster to $28.9 million from $12.4 million as revenues rose to $1.504 billion from $1.016 billion.
The company has greatly expanded its share base with its stock-swap acquistions and had average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 374 million, up from 283 million a year earlier.
"All four business segments had very good quarters," he said.
Republic has opened three AutoNation stores so far in 1997 and had planned to open 10 more this year, but was adding four or five stores.
"We are pleased with the performance of the AutoNation stores," he said.
Beyond auto sales and rentals, Republic sells security services and operates waste haulage businesses.
