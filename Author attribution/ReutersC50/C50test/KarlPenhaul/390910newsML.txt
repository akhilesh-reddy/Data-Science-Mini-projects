Colombia's lower house of Congress on Wednesday approved a law that will almost triple maximum jail terms for drug traffickers.
The bill, passed unanimously without debate, was approved by the Senate late on Tuesday and is set to be put on the statute books after presidential signature by next week.
The vote is likely to please the United States, which is due to announce shortly whether it will again blacklist Colombia for failing to crack down hard enough on drug trafficking.
The legislation effectively eliminates what the U.S. government has termed Colombia's "lax" anti-narcotics laws and raises the maximum jail term for drug-related crimes to 60 years from the current maximum of 24.
"We have just approved the toughest anti-drug penalties in Colombian history. Those taffickers who continue committing crimes from jail now see that we have got serious," legislator Roy Barreras told Congress.
He denounced U.S. pressure to rush the law through Congress and urged fellow politicians not to debate a new bill to overturn Colombia's five-year ban on extradition until the annual U.S. decision on so-called "certification" is known.
President Bill Clinton is scheduled to announce Feb. 27 whether Colombia should be certified as a trustworthy ally in the drug war.
Government officials have said in the past that tougher prison sentences could help Colombia win back certification, which was withdrawn last March.
"This is a historic step. Colombia may produce drugs but we also produce strong laws to combat drug trafficking and crime," said Justice Minister Carlos Medellin.
U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette expressed satisfaction at the tougher sentencing guidelines but said they still had not reached U.S. standards.
"This is a great agreement ... we're very pleased with it," Frechette said. When asked whether the accord would help avert the threat of U.S. sanctions against Colombia, he added: "We cannot ignore something as important as this."
