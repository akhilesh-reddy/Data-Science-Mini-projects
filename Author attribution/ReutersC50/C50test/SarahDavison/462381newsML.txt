Asian stocks face a jittery week, anticipating a rise in the U.S. Federal funds rate at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Tuesday.
Concerns about interest rates caused the U.S. Dow Jones index to fall this past week. The index fell 15 points on Friday to 6805 although rate fears weren't seen as a major factor for the day.
But the rate jitters are expected to be exacerbated in Asia by local factors ranging from Taiwan's ban on all pork exports due to an outbreak of deadly hog foot-and-mouth disease to continued gloom in Singapore because of poor export figures.

HONG KONG - Share prices have taken a beating over recent weeks due to uncertainty over whether the U.S. interest rates will go up, but analysts said stocks could move higher once Tuesday's FOMC meeting is out of the way.
The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 247.23 points, or 1.94 percent, in the past week to close at 12,489.30 on Friday.
"If they announce a 25 basis point rise, Hong Kong will probably recover to around the 13,000 level because I think it (selling) is just overdone," said ING Barings sales director James Osborn.
Analysts said earnings growth was strong and that, whatever the Fed meeting brought, the uncertainty would be cleared and investors could focus on local fundamentals.

TOKYO - Tokyo stocks are expected to plough higher as investors try to ensure the indices finish the fiscal year ending March 31 on a positive note, brokers said.

The 225-share Nikkei benchmark index closed up 139.45 points, or 0.75 percent, at 18,633.16 on Friday, capping a five-session winning streak in which it gained 3.5 percent.

TAIPEI - Taiwan share prices are expected to consolidate in the week beginning March 24 following Taiwan's ban on all pork exports due to an outbreak of hog foot-and-mouth disease.
The ban sent the island's food and livestock shares tumbling on Friday. Brokers said food shares can expect more losses and recent government attempts to cool what is seen as an overheated stock market will also dampen sentiment.
The weighted index plunged 262.60 points to 8,230.07 on Friday, compared to an 8,275.57 finish a week earlier. Consolidation is now expected between 8,000 and 8,400 points.

SINGAPORE - Singapore shares face an uncertain week with no signs of encouraging news to lift the market, dealers said.

The key Straits Times Industrials Index ended at 2,068.48 on Friday, down 66.98 on the previous week's close. It was battered by poor non-oil domestic export figures, worries over U.S. interest rates and disappointing corporate results.

The composite stock index closed on Friday at 627.08, 14.45 points, or 2.25 percent, lower than the previous Friday.

JAKARTA - Jakarta share prices are expected to remain mixed but trading would be relatively slow until the FOMC meeting.
Brokers said lingering concern over a possible competitor to bellwether stock Telkom could also hurt sentiment.
But brokers said the listing of three companies on three consecutive days from March 25-27 could boost market activity.
On Friday, the Jakarta Composite Index closed 7.03 points, or 1.06 percent lower, to 656.11 points, against the previous Friday's 666.84 close, a loss of about 1.6 percent on the week.

KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysian stocks will focus on the FOMC meeting and Wall Street's response, analysts said.

SYDNEY - Australian shares are seen focused tightly on U.S. markets, with all eyes on a possible U.S. interest rate rise and the Dow's response.
The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,386.4, down 36.8 points or 1.5 percent for the week on increasing jitters about U.S. stocks, which are seen here as overvalued, and U.S. bonds.
"I think everybody is going to be waiting on what the bonds are going to do and what the Dow is going to do," Mercantile Mutual equities director Greg Matthews said.
