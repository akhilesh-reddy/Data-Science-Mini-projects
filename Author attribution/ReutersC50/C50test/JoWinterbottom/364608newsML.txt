British supermarket group Safeway Plc is currently seeing a zero inflation rate excluding petrol, deputy chairman David Webster told Reuters in an interview.
"Inflation excluding petrol is now probably zero," he said.
But Webster said the fall in prices was "nothing to do with a price war."  
Webster said he felt shoppers "are pulling in their belts a little more than usual," and added he felt it was "a sector issue."
But he said he thought a price war remained "very unlikely."
Safeway said in a statement that price inflation had fallen in the early weeks of the new year from a modest 1.1 percent gain seen in the five weeks to January 4.
It said sales growth over the key Christmas trading period had been 5.2 percent but over the first 16 weeks of the second half that had slowed to a 4.5 percent gain.
"In the last four weeks the sector and Safeway have come off quite sharply in terms of overall sales performance," Webster said.
Safeway said in its statement that if current rates of sales growth and inflation continued, profits in the final eight weeks of its year, which ends in March, might be affected.
Webster said it was "very hard to judge" whether the slowdown in sales would continue. "We continue to see significant deflation in produce, which is 10 percent of total sales," he said.
He declined to give details of the impact on margins, however.
