If British regional electricity company (Rec) Northern Electric succumbs to a hostile 782 million pounds ($1.3 billion) bid from U.S. group CE Electric, it will be the tenth Rec of the 12 privatised in 1990 to be taken over.
Northern is the only Rec to have fought off a takeover, thwarting a bid from Trafalgar House, now part of Norway's Kvaerner, with a 560 million pound defence last year.
The bid from CE Electric, controlled by CalEnergy, has been vigorously opposed by Northern and closes at 1300 GMT on Friday. If the bid succeeds, it would take to six the number of Recs already in or due to move into U.S. hands.
Only two independent Recs would remain if Northern fell -- Southern and Yorkshire, which is the only one never to have attracted a firm bid.
Southern agreed to a takeover by generator National Power but this was blocked by the British government in April, along with fellow generator PowerGen's planned bid for Midlands.
Two Recs -- Norweb and South Wales Electricity (Swalec) -- were swallowed by their local water and sewerage firms to form multi-utilities while Manweb was taken over by generator Scottish Power, which later added Southern Water to its fold.
Eastern Electricity was bought by conglomerate Hanson, which intends to spin it off as part of its energy group.
Three Recs -- South Western, Seeboard and Midlands -- have already been bought by American firms and two more, London and East Midlands, have agreed to bids from U.S. companies.
