Nomura Securities Co Ltd paid more than 70 million yen ($555,000) via stock deals into accounts linked to a racketeer, the securities firm's former president said on Tuesday.
Hideo Sakamaki, who stepped down from his post last month to take the blame for the payoff scandal, said internal Nomura investigations had discovered a total of five irregular stock deals through which the money was transferred.
Nomura announced on Tuesday that Sakamaki's replacement, Masashi Suzuki, would also resign, along with 15 board members, in a sweeping reshuffle of the company's top management resulting from the scandal.
Sakamaki, who was testifying before a committee of the Upper House of parliament, said that one of the irregular stock deals included a transaction involving more than seven million shares of a commercial bank on March 15, 1993.
Asked whether it was true that Nomura provided trading profits of more than 70 million yen ($555,000) through five suspected stock deals, Sakamaki said: "I think the amount is something like that."
It was the first time a Nomura insider had publicly revealed the amount of money transferred to the racketeer.
Prosecutors and the securities watchdog are investigating Nomura for deals involving the racketeer, or "sokaiya". Such racketeers extort money from a company by threatening to disrupt its shareholders' meetings.
A Japanese news service reported on Tuesday that the Ministry of Finance was likely to suspend some of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as a punishment for the scandal.
Asked if there were accounts at Nomura linked to other racketeers, Sakamaki said that he believed there were no such accounts.
He said that while he believed that only the two directors were involved in the payoffs, he was also responsible himself for causing the scandal as Nomura's top manager.
He said that Nomura would work out measures to avoid a recurrence of such a scandal. ($=126 yen)
