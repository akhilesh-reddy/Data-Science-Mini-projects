A major reshuffle of executives at scandal-tainted Nomura Securities Co Ltd should help the brokerage transform its corporate culture and restore investors' trust, analysts and company sources said on Tuesday.
"I think the resignation of many executives will have a good impact on Nomura as it will make it easier for new management to reform its corporate culture," said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice-president of Smith Barney International Inc.
The drastic reshuffling was a surprise, and could be what is needed to help encourage small investors to return to Japan's stock markets, he added.
Earlier on Tuesday, Nomura announced that president Masashi Suzuki will resign on May 1 and will be replaced by managing director Junichi Ujiie.
Nomura also said that 15 company board members, including five vice presidents and four senior managing directors, will resign on April 30 and become company advisers.
Suzuki, who will retain his chairmanship but lose his right to represent the company, told a news conference that the executives will not join in the decision-making process after they become advisers and are expected to leave Nomura to join companies affiliated with Nomura.
