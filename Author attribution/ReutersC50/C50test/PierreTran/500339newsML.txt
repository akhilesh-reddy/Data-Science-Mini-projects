Holding company Cie de Suez and utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux are expected Friday to announce a merger, effectively ending the independence of the company set up in the 19th century to build the Suez Canal.
The boards of the two companies will meet Friday to approve terms of the link-up, which has already received the backing of the Lyonnaise board.
Lyonnaise Chairman Jerome Monod said last Thursday that a combination with Suez was an excellent option, but the terms had not been fixed.
The deal would mark the end of autonomy for Suez, which fell victim in the 1990s to a deeply distressed property market -- ironic since it was founded in 1858 by Ferdinand de Lesseps to build and operate the property asset that symbolised the glory of French Empire and engineering, the Suez Canal.
Discontented Suez shareholders forced out the previous chairman, Gerard Worms, after the group reported a four billion franc ($690 million at current rates) loss in 1995 and installed Gerard Mestrallet to turn round the sprawling conglomerate.
Mestrallet quickly sold crown jewels such as investment bank Banque Indosuez and fund manager Gartmore, as well as the ailing real estate portfolio, leaving Suez with more than five billion francs ($863 million) in cash.
He held on to a 63-percent stake in Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique, which groups some choice industrial and financial assets.
SGB welcomed Suez as a white knight in the late 1980s, when it was being stalked by Italian businessman Carlo de Benedetti, who saw it as ripe for takeover.
Now it looks as if SGB could be the saviour for Suez. Stock market analysts say that if there is any industrial logic in the merger, it lies in Mestrallet's focus on the utilities sector and abandoning financial services.
SGB has a 37 percent stake in Tractebel, which specialises in electricity, gas, water and environmental services. It has operations in cable television, property, infrastructure and industrial installations -- areas that overlap with Lyonnaise.
Lyonnaise, under veteran chairman Monod, has set its sights on international expansion in utilities but lacks the financial muscle to fund that growth. A link-up would inject fresh capital from Suez's cash hoard -- even after an estimated 3.4 billion franc ($587 million) payment to sweeten Suez shareholders on the merger.
Monod said last week that a merged Suez/Lyonnaise would be a multi-service company on a global scale and capable of boosting profits and cashflow.
