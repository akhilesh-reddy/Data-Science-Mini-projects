Shares in British mobile telephone operator Orange Plc, languishing below their flotation price, rose on Monday after the company said it had more than doubled its total subscriber base to over 785,000 customers during 1996.
Orange, priced at 205p when floated 10 months ago, added 4p to 192p after the company said it had added 125,000 customers in the last three months of 1996, its best ever quarter.
The positive trend in the British cellular market was confirmed by subscriber figures issued later on Monday by One 2 One, a joint venture between Cable &amp; Wireless Plc and a unit of US West Media Group.
One 2 One, the smallest UK operator, said the Christmas 1996 period was its best-ever quarter, gaining 85,000 customers to take its total to 545,000 -- an eight percent market share.
"The final quarter has generally been quite good for mobile phone companies and the trend is positive after four disappointing quarters," said analyst James Ross of broker ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
Vodafone Group, the market leader in Britain, last week reported a 20 percent annual increase in subscriber numbers to some 2.8 million at end-December.
Cellnet, 60-percent owned by British Telecommunications, ended last year with 2.68 million UK customers, up from 2.3 million at the end of 1995.
Analysts said that Orange shares had good upside potential after a rollercoaster ride in their short time on the market. They rose to 260p shortly after a heavily-oversubscribed flotation only to dip below 160p after the initial glow faded for a company not expected to make a profit until 1998.
James Dodd of Kleinwort Benson said he regarded a level of 240p as fair value for shares in Orange, in which Hong-Kong based Hutchison Whampoa Ltd and British Aerospace remain the leading stakeholders.
Dodd noted that BT's plans to raise the price of calls to Orange and One 2 One handsets would be beneficial. The new rates, to take effect next month, could boost revenues by 10 percent per subscriber.
Orange said it now had an 11.5 percent share of the total UK market, against seven percent at the end of 1995. It said its "churn" or disconnection rate of 18.6 percent in 1996 was around a third below the industry average.
"We stay right on our plan for growth of subscribers, market share, usage, network coverage and churn," said managing director Hans Snook.
"We look forward in 1997 to continuing to move ahead and to extending our international service through new roaming agreements and the introduction of dual band handsets."
The new handsets, to be launched in the first half of 1997, should extend potential coverage to most European countries.
