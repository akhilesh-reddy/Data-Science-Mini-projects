Shares in British publisher Dorling Kindersley Holdings Plc lost almost 20 percent of their value on Tuesday after the company warned that profits would fall short of last year's level.
Traders wiped over 40 million pounds ($64 million) off Dorling's value as the company warned tough conditions in the U.S. retail book market, currency movements and increased investment in its direct selling business would hit profits.
It restated its profits for the year to end-June 1996 to 12.9 million pounds ($20.5 million) from 17.4 million pounds to reflect a change in the way it accounts for multimedia development costs.
Managing director Rod Hare said profits would fall "somewhat short" of 12.9 million pounds but would not specify how much.
The warning, the second in little more than three months, sent Dorling shares spiralling 60p lower to 261p by 1025 GMT.
The value of the company has halved to around 180 million pounds since the company warned of the likely impact of sterling strength in early December.
Dorling reported a nine percent rise in pre-tax profit to 6.8 million pounds in the six months to December 31. Interim dividend was left unchanged at 1.5 pence per share.
"The primary factor for the downgrade in the profit forecast is...the U.S. book market has not performed as expected," managing director Hare told Reuters.
Hare said that Dorling had suffered from a change in policy at leading U.S. book retail chains Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble, which had cleared out their stock and cut new orders after their store expansion programmes slowed.
Hare said that Dorling believed that a more normal re-order pattern would be restored later this year for back order books, However, he expects the U.S. chains to continue to order less initial stock of new titles.
Dorling earns more than 40 percent of revenue in dollars and Hare said that the strength of the pound would result in "well over a million pounds of lost profit" this year. ($1=.6281 Pound)
