British media and leisure company Granada Group Plc said on Friday it planned to close around 100 of its 560 high street rental and retail stores.
"Today we told staff that we are reviewing the position of stores with a view to closing about 100 of the least profitable and least successful," a company spokeswoman said.
Granada employs some 1,500 full-time staff and 430 part-timers in its stores across Britain. It would not be drawn on how many would lose their jobs.
"At this stage locations have not been identified," the spokeswoman added. The closures are scheduled to begin in May after a three-month consultation period with workers.
The announcement came on the day that Granada announced it had joined forces with fellow British television groups BSkyB and Carlton to bid for digital terrestrial television licences.
Granada has expanded into one of Britain's leading companies in recent years. Last January it acquired the Forte catering and hotel empire in a 3.9 billion pounds ($6.25 billion) takeover.
However, the importance of its rental division has been diminishing in comparison with the rest of the group.
The shops sell household electrical goods and also support the company's television and video rental operations.
Granada has been reducing the number of its stores in recent years to end high street duplication. Growing numbers of customers have been switching to a direct rental operation where they do all their business by telephone.
Granada said in its 1996 annual report that rationalisation of its shop network was "nearing completion" after recent cuts.
The company is expected to move to bigger stores in some towns and is likely to keep around 450 shops. It believes that the stores will eventually focus purely on retail activity.
