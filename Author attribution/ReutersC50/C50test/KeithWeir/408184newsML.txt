British Sky Broadcasting Plc emphasised its commitment to digital television on Thursday and warned that the UK was falling behind its European neighbours in the move into the new era.
"Our clear and unambiguous aim is to be in the vanguard of the digital era," BSkyB deputy managing director David Chance told a Financial Times conference on New Media and Broadcasting.
BSkyB, the leading force in British pay television with some 5.5 million subscribers, plans to launch 200-channel digital satellite services into the UK later this year.
It has also joined forces with UK commercial television giants Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc to apply for licences to operate digitial terrestrial television (DTT) services.
Their British Digital Broadcasting consortium faces competition from DTN, owned by Nasdaq-listed cable company International CableTel, for three key DTT licences.
Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) is expected to announce a decision on the licences around May.
DTT, broadcast from land-based transmitters to standard television aerials, is scheduled to begin in mid-1998 and offer a total of around 30 channels.
Chance said that he hoped that neither UK nor European regulators would oppose British Digital Broadcasting if it were awarded the DTT licences.
"Eight years ago we led Europe in multi-channel TV," Chance said. "We are probably the last in Europe to launch a digital platform...It isn't the time for a handbrake to be applied."
"We are behind and we need to get on with it."
Digital television offers extra channels, improved sound and picture quality and the potential to access interactive services
