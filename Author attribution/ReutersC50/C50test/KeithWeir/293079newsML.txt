Shares in Pearson Plc gained on Wednesday as new chief executive Marjorie Scardino officially took the reins at the diversified British media and leisure company.
Scardino, who becomes the first woman to head one of Britain's leading companies, has already said that Pearson's profit performance has been inadequate and disposals are expected as she aims for greater focus on core businesses.
Pearson shares added 8.5 pence to 738.5 pence, reflecting hopes that she will shake up what critics regard as a slumbering giant.
Scardino, a 49-year-old Texan, had been chief executive of The Economist Group, a magazine company half owned by Pearson. A Pearson spokeswoman said Scardino spent her first day "meeting the troops" at the company's central London headquarters.
She has already met her fellow executives and share analysts are hoping for some swift action to focus a company which is accused by critics of underexploiting a stellar group of assets.
Its businesses range from the Financial Times newspaper to Penguin books and a television production arm which makes low-budget programmes such as Australian soap "Neighbours".
Analysts identify Pearson's investment banking interests, its theme park businesses and loss-making U.S. software publishing company Mindscape as the obvious candidates for sale.
Pearson's Tussauds Group unit includes London's landmark Madame Tussaud's waxwork exhibition and theme parks such as Alton Towers in England and Spain's Port Aventura.
It also has a 50 percent stake in London investment bank Lazard Brothers and smaller holdings in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York.
Pearson effectively has a new management team following changes to the board last year.
The process will be complete when Dennis Stevenson replaces Michael Blakenham as chairman in May. Stevenson is currently deputy chairman.
