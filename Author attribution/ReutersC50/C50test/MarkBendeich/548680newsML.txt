Australian steel-maker The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) on Tuesday announced the closure of Australia's oldest steel-making plant, an industrial icon which it said could no longer match its Asian competitors.
BHP's Newcastle mill, a milestone in the nation's industrial development when opened in 1915, will shut down its blast furnaces by the end of 1999 as part of a major overhaul of BHP's global steel business, the company said.  
BHP chief executive John Prescott, who like his predecessors forged his early career at Newcastle, was unsentimental in announcing the closure, which will end 2,500 workers' jobs.
"The fundamental purpose of all the change is to ensure a viable industry going forward," Prescott told reporters.
"We are not walking away from the steel industry," he added.
BHP now faces possible industrial action from trade unions, one of which said the closure would directly and indirectly destroy up to 12,000 jobs Australia wide.  
A mass meeting of Newcastle workers at the site next Friday is expected to consider calling a strike against the company, an Australian Workers Union (AWU) official said.
The AWU's Newcastle secretary, Mauri Rudd, told Reuters that a strike, if called, would try to block BHP exports.
BHP, Australia's biggest company, is also a major exporter of Australian coal, iron ore, liquefied natural gas and manganese.
