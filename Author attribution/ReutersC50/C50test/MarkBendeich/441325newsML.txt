Australia's biggest retailer Coles Myer Ltd on Thursday reported a 41 percent surge in half-year earnings, its first profit rise in almost two years.
The result buoyed Coles' once-sinking share price, which firmed despite a weaker market, and follows a two-year nightmare of sliding profits, controversy and tight-fisted consumers.
Coles, which pockets nearly 18 cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, reported a net profit of A$273.6 million for half-year ended January 26, against A$194.5 million a year ago.  
Before abnormals, net earnings leapt 23 percent to a better-than-expected A$229 million, boosting the shares 10 cents above Wednesday's close to A$6.01 (US$4.74) in morning trade.
"What is important are people's expectations of the turnaround now. I think that's why the stock is where it is, on anticipation of much better margins and profit," a broker said.
Coles also on Thursday gave a bullish forecast for the full year ending July 27, suggesting it expected more double-digit profit growth in the second half of 1996/97.
