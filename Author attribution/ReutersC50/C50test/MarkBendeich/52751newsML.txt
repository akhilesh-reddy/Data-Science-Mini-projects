Australian industrial conglomerate Pacific Dunlop Ltd has dived into red ink in an effort to put two years of "sobering" financial woes behind it, declaring on Friday a full-year loss of A$132 million.
The group's earnings for the year to June 30 included a net abnormal loss of A$296 million, reflecting management's decision to cast off its troubled U.S. medical equipment unit and book over A$80 million in restructuring charges and asset writedowns.  
"This is a clean-out result and it gives both myself and my managenent team an absolutely clean slate on which to write the next chapter of Pacific Dunlop's history," group managing director Rod Chadwick said in announcing the result.
Pacific Dunlop's recent history has been dominated by severe problems faced by its Telectronics subsidiary, which is now up for sale after a defect in one of its cardiac-implant products effectively put the unit out of business for 13 months.
"We have so far had six deaths from this problem over the last two years," Chairman John Gough told reporters.  
The problem was first detected in Telectronics Accufix pacemaker lead in late 1994.
Telectronics' losses accounted for A$340 million of gross abnormal losses, including a provision of A$91 million for the expected loss on the eventual sale of the business.
"We are in very advanced negotiations," said Gough, who called the problem with the pacemaker leads "in many ways ... an act of God" and unforeseeable.
