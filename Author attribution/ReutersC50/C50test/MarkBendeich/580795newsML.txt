Australian paper and packaging giant Amcor Ltd, continuing a run of depressing profit results and forecasts, said on Tuesday that it hoped the worst would be over in 1996/97 (July/June).  
Amcor managing director Don Macfarlane said full-year net profit would be lower than the A$338.8 million achieved in 1995/96 but he saw paper prices rising from early calendar 1998.
"If you read the things we have said since the half-year (profit announcement) you would have to come to that conclusion," Macfarlane told Reuters.
"Hopefully this is the worst of it," he added.
His comments followed a statement in which Amcor said second half results would be lower than a year-ago and than the 1996/97 first half. There would also be some significant write-downs.
