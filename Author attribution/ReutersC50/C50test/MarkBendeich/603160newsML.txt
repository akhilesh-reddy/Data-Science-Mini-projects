The world's biggest miner, RTZ-CRA, said on Wednesday it needed to polish its public image after it came under attack for the second time in as many weeks.
A fortnight after protesters swarmed on the group's London annual meeting, Australian trade unionists and conservationists infiltrated a shareholders' meeting in Melbourne, criticising its record on human rights, labour and environmental issues.  
RTZ-CRA's Australian chairman, John Uhrig, and some of the protesters, speaking as Australian shareholders or their proxy, engaged at times in shouting matches inside the meeting hall.
Trade unionists from Australia's coal and iron ore industries accused RTZ-CRA of intimidating workers, while others claimed it refused to stand up against human rights abuses.
Uhrig strongly denied the accusations and appeared to feel protesters were hijacking the meeting, insisting other shareholders be allowed to speak.
He finally called on a vote to have the meeting closed.  
But later, speaking to reporters, he said work needed to be done to improve the group's public image. "In the general community, I am sure we have a job to do," Uhrig said.
The company needs to do more work in Australia to improve its public image than probably elsewhere in the world, because the group enjoys such a high profile here, he added.
He referred in particular to RTZ-CRA's labour relations.
"The general public really does not understand what we have done and maybe that needs to be explained," Uhrig said.
