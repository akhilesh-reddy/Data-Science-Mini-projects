Australian financial services group Colonial Ltd made a strong debut on the Australian share market on Monday, its share price soaring on listing.
In early trading, Colonial shares opened at A$3.31, well above the A$3.10 paid by institutional investors in the company's public share offer, which closed last Friday.
The opening price eclipsed the A$2.60 paid by members of the public in the A$690 million float, but those who took their stag profits and ran on Monday failed to make a lasting impression.  
In late morning trade, Colonial shares were trading around the opening price, giving the company a market capitalisation of A$1.9 billion and putting it in the top 50 Australian companies.
"We are obviously delighted that we have come on with a premium. It's a strong market response," Colonial managing director Peter Smedley said after watching the opening share price flash up on the stock exchange boards in Melbourne.
Colonial on Monday became only the second life office to list on the local exchange, after one of its bigger rivals, National Mutual Holdings Ltd, debuted last October.
