Chad faces cereal shortages in 1997 but appeals for aid from one of the world's poorest nations have met sceptical responses from some foreign donors alleging mismanagement of available stocks.
Chad asked donors to replenish 50,000 tonnes of emergency cereal stocks in a New Year appeal by recently elected President Idriss Deby.
In the 1996 campaign year, leading to the country's first multiparty legislative elections in almost 30 years in January, Chad also acknowledged a shoot-to-kill policy against some criminals.
Human rights groups told Reuters petty grain pilferers had been summarily executed for stealing derisory amounts from public markets.
GOVERNMENT MAKING SHORTAGE WORSE
Donors accuse officials in the arid landlocked state of making food shortages more acute.
The half-desert country usually keeps 25,000 tonnes as an emergency buffer stock with another 25,000 tonnes for immediate emergency use.
"The problem is that stocks have been emptied for political reasons. There has been a problem with donors about that," said Joseph Alain Charriere, the U.N. World Food Programme's representative in Chad.
"That does not mean there will not be extreme hardship this year. It is very bad but not catastrophic." he told Reuters.
The government says storehouses are precariously empty but the government's opponents point to vote-buying.
"There are ways of making people's lives more comfortable around election time," said one opposition party leader and former National Assembly leader Jean Alingue. "Don't forget that 80 percent of Chadians live in the country and are mostly poor."
CHAD SAYS SHORTAGE CRITICIAL
Chadian officials say urgent action is required as women struggle to set aside private stocks at village level to tide over their families through Chad's regular droughts.
The Director of Food Security, Ali Adoum Djourou, told Reuters recently that shortages could last until October. He cited a Rural Development Ministry report for December putting Chad's 1996/97 cereal deficit at just under 200,000 tonnes.
The United States aid agency USAID closed its Chad bureau last year as part of wider cuts while European stock donations have recently dwindled out of a preference for boosting grass-root production instead, say U.N. officials.
Donors agree severe drought has hit the Sahel region but they dispute food reserves are needed, pointing to a European early warning study putting Sahel area shortages at 17,000 tonnes instead of the government's forecast of 50,000 tonnes.
While donors recognise the deteriorating food situation is serious they also point to non-cereal food alternatives left out of food need calculations.
"All the elements that can lead to famine are nevertheless there," said Charriere. "Output is down, cereal prices are rising, and transportation is difficult. People will be forced to sell whatever they have -- goats and camels -- just to survive."
PRICES ALREADY SURGING
Prices were already spinning out of control, even though some of that was caused by speculation.
"Normally we would expect millet prices of 7,000-8,000 CFA (francs) per 100 kilos. Now we are seeing 12,000 CFA and we expect the price to rise to 15,000 or 17,000 CFA in 1997," said Charriere.
Chad, one the world's poorest nations, puts its annual cereal consumption at over one million tonnes with output seen at 840,000 tonnes in 1996/97, against 900,000 last year and a record 1.12 million tonnes in 1994/95.
The population stands at 6.9 million from 6.4 million in 1995 and 6.2 million in 1993.
FAO says production of one staple cereal, berbere, used in calculations could prove to be higher that the 90,000 tonnes anticipated.
"About 13 percent of the 200,000 deficit is really urgent," Chad director Pierre Gence told Reuters. "That would mean 25,000 tonnes."
Donors say poor roads, armed banditry, and farmers switching to more lucrative cotton crops in the unaffected south have made prospects worse.
Chad stepped up border patrols against rebel groups and smugglers around Lake Chad but donors say it is easier for some farmers to sell produce abroad when roads are closed by rains.
