Heavy late-March rains favoured Ivorian mid-crop cocoa harvest prospects as the month's rainfall total edged up to long-term average levels after a February drought, weather and crop analysts said on Monday.
"The rains have been very satisfactory lately," said a National Weather centre spokesman. "We are back to around average levels and the rains are continuing into April."
Official weather data for the third 10 days of March showed rains at 10 weather stations totalled 742 mm against 208 mm in the previous 10 days. An average of 111 mm fell in March.
Crop analysts said weather data weighted for plantation density and long term productivity suggested the March rains were in line with a 20-year average of around 105 mm.
Rains falling on average on five out of ten days were spread widely over Ivory Coast's cocoa belt but heaviest falls were in central areas around Daloa, Gagnoa, Yamoussoukro and Abidjan.
"Everything now depends on the (mid-crop) pod-count," said one drop analyst.
"We had good January rains, bad February rains and good March rains. I remain an optimist (for midcrop harvest volumes)," he added.
Rains during the second ten days of March were heaviest in less productive eastern border areas.
Otherwise, south-western forest areas, densely planted with productive hybrid trees, have tended to receive the most.
Crop analysts said in early March that regular showers up to April would determine how close this year's mid-crop would be to the bumper 200,000 tonnes in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) harvest season.
The 1996/97 mid-crop could exceed 150,000 tonnes if rains were sufficient, one said, adding that harvest predictions would be reviewed in April when pods on trees gave a better idea of yields.
The data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the third 10 days of March in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days in brackets):
Daloa 105.8 (2.7), Gagnoa 142.8 (20.2), San Pedro 18.3 (12.6), Tabou 1.0 (21) Man 98.7 (2.0), Dimbokro 73.2 (32.3), Yamoussoukro 83.8 (0), Abidjan 128.8 (8.9), Sassandra 10.6 (8.8), Adiake 64.5 (13.9), Korhogo 14.2 (0).
