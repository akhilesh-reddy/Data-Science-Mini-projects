Ivory Coast's cocoa mid-crop (May-Sept) could match harvest forecasts of over 150,000 tonnes but bean sizes are seen down from the record 1995/96 season (Oct-Sept), crop analysts and exporters said on Thursday.
"The development seems to be coming along quite nicely," said one. "It is still early but I see no reason to suspect the mid-crop will be poor."
Good peak wet season rains in June would decide the final mid-crop tally but this year's bean sizes are not expected to match the mainly exportable grades (105 beans per 100 grammes) seen in the record 1.2 million tonnes (total crop) 1995/96 year.
"Last year's mid-crop (200,000 tonnes) was exceptional. I think the sizes will return to more normal levels," said another crop analyst, pointing to a range of 110-120 range with lowest grades possibly touching 150.
Ivory Coast's main crop reached around one million tonnes by the season's closing date of April 27. Crop analysts expect the mid-crop to be down on 1995/96 with some early forecasts in a 160-180,000 tonnes range.
Crop analysts said said plantation soil moiture levels had dropped in some areas after heavy wet season rains in April eased off in the first ten days of May.
"There was less moisture than I thought there would be, but it is not a problem," said one.
Bean sizes would swell if June rains were sufficient.
"I do not have a pessimistic view of mid-crop," said the analyst. "As far as I am concerned soil humidity is average but our teams have not yet completed their tour."
Crop analysts returning from upcountry farm inspections reported little harvesting and drying of cocoa. They did not expect mid-crop arrivals at port to strenghten until June -- after a lull in activity between the main and mid-crops.
"What is there will sit around for mixing in with better beans and larger quantities. It is just not worth the farmers selling yet," said one.
Exporters say late main crop and a trickle of mid-crop beans arriving at ports are in a 105-110 range.
"Last year, even the tail of the mid-crop met export standards," said one. Special contracts for grades outside the official export standard would still be exported.
"Discounts will be applied, as for poor coffee beans, but it will all be exported," he added.
Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa crop by the year 2,000, partly to remove poorer grades from export markets, but also to push up world prices while adding export value.
Local processors, with three factories, have a total bean processing capacity of around 160,000 tonnes.
That figure could rise to at least 209,000 tonnes in 1996/97 as local factories build extensions and possible oil-palm factory capacity for cocoa bean processing comes on line.
Other factories already under construction or in final planning stages could take Ivorian bean processing capacity to over 350,000 tonnes by 1998/99 (Corrects from 1997/98) -- without taking into account a raft of plans in early discussion stages.
