Gold output from Ivory Coast's second mine, SOMIAF, is set to double over the next two years and could rise further as sulphide deposit studies are completed, an operations manager said on Thursday.
"We just started on a (350,000 tonne) new gold oxide lens which will take over a year to mine," operations manager Joe Hinzer told Reuters. "We have a second lens close to it which we plan to blend in which could take one and half years."
SOMIAF (Societe des Mines d'Afema) announced two new oxide deposits totalling 510,000 tonnes with a gold content of up to 4.5 grammes/tonne in early April after commissioning a doubling of factory capacity last month.
Gold production is set to rise to 935 kilos in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) from 600 kilos in 1995/96 -- with calendar year yields of 950 kilos (1997) and 622 (1996), Hinzer said.
Output could reach 1,000-1,300 kilos in 1997/98 and continue rising if new sulphide deposits under study for at least two more years proved to be exploitable, he said.
SOMIAF, is 68 percent-ownded by Canada's Eden Roc, with another 32 percent held by Ivory Coast. It owns one permit (120 sq km) and manages two nearby exploration sites (1,380 sq km) for a joint venture between state mining group Sodemi and Eden Roc.
Oxide deposits were being reassessed after recent management changes Hinzer said in an interview this week, putting total recoverable oxide gold at 500,000 ounces.
"We are counting the marbles now but about 30 percent of that is proven, probable or possible" he said.
Average ore grade from the latest oxide deposit to be worked would mean an average 1997 gold grade of 5 g/t at leach pads against 1.9 g/t last year, said Hinzer.
SOMIAF, which employs 350 permanent and 150 temporary staff invested $10-12 million to get operations underway in 1992.
Eden Roc's new president Mario Caron will officially take control of SOMIAF during a visit pencilled in for May, said Hinzer.
Studies of gold suphide deposits are already advanced.
A $10 million pre-feasibility sulphide study could be completed in two to three years but the cost of a new plant to handle sulphide ore, on top of recent oxide capacity expansion, could reach $35-40 million, said Hinzer.
"There are no hard numbers but we hope to identify 3-3.5 million ounces of gold. When we have the figures we can move on to feasibility and factory plans," he added.
"We have drilled over 1,000 holes, or 82,000 metres," he added. "Before feasibility studies we would need to put in another 40,000 metres of tests."
Promising areas lay along a broken 12 km strike within SOMIAF's exisitng permits, which in Ivory Coast are issued for three years and are renewable twice for two years.
Oxide mining is open cast but sulphide deposits could mean ramp mining or other deeper deposit recovery techniques.
Ivory Coast's largest mine, Societe des Mines d'Ity (SMI), is also planning to dig deeper for growth, SMI president Yves Palanque told Reuters.
"We will reach the water table in two years and will need to buy new equipment to deal with wet mining," said Palanque.
Sub-contractors mine the site but in two years SMI will take direct control over operations.
Production is running at 1.5 tonnes of pure gold per annum with 7.5 tonnes produced since 1991 and reserves put at 27 tonnes. Exploration to raise gold output is focused on a nearby 900 square km block.
Ivory Coast is keen to develop mining to broaden its agriculture-based economy and opened a Mines Commission this week to cut red tape for investors and prospectors.
Around 55 exploration permits have been issued to a total of up to 25 firms, many of which have arrived since the introduction of a new mining code in 1995.
