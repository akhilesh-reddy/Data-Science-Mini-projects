Ivory Coast exported 16,307 tonnes of robusta coffee beans in March, against 13,527 in February and 20,903 in March 1996, official shipping data show.
Ivorian coffee marketing started later than usual in 1996/97 after low world prices in late 1996, tighter bank lending policies to exporters and quality problems that slowed grading, exporters said.
"This year is slower but there is still plenty of coffee about," said one industry buyer, noting that the season opened in mid-November rather than October.
The data showed 12,904 tonnes of March exports went from Abidjan, the main port, with 3,403 shipped from Ivory Coast's second port of San Pedro.
Cumulative exports in the first six months of the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) season were 45,783 tonnes against 58,667 in the same period of 1995/96.
Coffee product exports, from Abidjan, included 694 tonnes of soluble coffee and six tonnes of roasted coffee.
Ivory Coast forecast a 1996/97 crop of 230,000 tonnes, against 180,000 tonnes recorded last year.
Port sources put arrivals by late March 1997 at over 175,000 tonnes but said Ivory Coast would at least meet its full year output forecast.
Some buyers are still sorting and grading at stores and say more coffee is still held in villages.
But they said the quality of coffee sacks had also been poor in some areas due a shortage of supply from exporters. Piles of loose coffee awaiting grading could be seen in upcountry buyers' stores last week.
