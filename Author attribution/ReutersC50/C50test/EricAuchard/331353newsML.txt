Cascade Communications Corp shares were crushed in a wave of selling Friday after company comments in a conference call stoked fears about future earnings.
Several analysts slashed ratings on Cascade, citing concern that growth rates for its core frame-relay switching business may be slowing to industry levels of 30-50 percent from its prior 100 percent plus.
The formerly high-flying data networking stock was off 19-3/4 to 44-3/8. All gains seen since April had evaporated.
