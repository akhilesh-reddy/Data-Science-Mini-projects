Racal Electronics said on Tuesday the joint savings from its link-up with ITT Defence of the U.S. and partner Siemens on the UK Ministry of Defence Bowman defence contract could total 100 million stg.
David Elsbury, Racal chief executive, said the decision to join forces with ITT's rival Crossbow consortium was due to the continued delays in the British government awarding the two billion pounds British Armed Forces communications contract. Elsbury said the group has now been assured of a decision on Bowman by March 1997.  
He said the move by Racal and partner Siemens to link-up with their rival consortium followed news from the UK government of further delays which meant the equipment would not be in soldiers' hands until 2002.
Both sides' bids were in danger of running to 100 million apiece on research and developments costs, said Elsbury. Racal's costs to date are running at between 30 and 50 million.
But the decision to join forces meant  "cost efficiency savings of 100 million" in total. He said if the Racal, ITT, Siemens team won, they would form a joint venture and take equity. "We're happy with the arrangements," said Elsbury.  
The contract is crucial to the group's future earnings. The winner of Bowman will get an estimated two billion stg in follow-through export orders on top of the two billion contract value.
Elsbury said the deal could create 6,500 new jobs. But there will be a rationalisation if the Bowman contract is lost.
"To win Bowman would be the prize. To lose Bowman, God forbid, we would still have a sizeable export market, but we would have to downsize the company."
He did not specify further, but said no decision on job cuts will be made before next year.
