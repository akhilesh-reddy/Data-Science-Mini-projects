Anglo-U.S. conglomerate Hanson Plc Thursday reported a record 1.8 billion British pounds ($2.9 billion) in pretax profits for the last fiscal year before it began a four-way split of its operations on Oct. 1.
The group spun off Imperial Tobacco and Millennium Chemicals in the fall. Its energy group is due to be spun off by February, leaving behind the building group.
The final results showed profits topping forecasts and up sharply from 1.22 billion ($1.98 billion) last year.
But the figures were inflated by a one-time gain of 609 million pounds ($989 million), compared with a charge of 98 million pounds ($159 million) last year.
Earnings per share were 25.6 pence (14.6 cents) vs. 18.2 pence (29.5 cents) and a dividend of 1 pence (1.6 cents) will be paid.
Of the two divisions that will remain, building materials and equipment saw profits slip to 231 million pounds ($375 million) from 237 million ($385 million). Sales were 2.45 billion ($3.98 billion) vs. 2.1 billion ($3.4 billion).
The British arm continued to suffer from tough housing and construction markets, but some signs of a turnaround were evident. Buoyant U.S. conditions helped to outweigh the negative effects of the British building market.
Energy enjoyed sharply higher profits, with strong growth overseas and a further gain in British profit and market share. The surge reflected Eastern electricity company's first full contribution since its takeover.
Peabody Coal saw profits slip to 154 million pounds ($250 million) from 160 million pouinds ($260 million) as it sought to raise productivity levels.
Lord Hanson, chairman and co-founder of the empire in the throes of the four-way split, said prospects for its "family of companies" was very good.
But he was less happy about the progress of its share price performance which he said was "very disappointing."
The combined value of Hanson and the demerged companies was 195 pence ($3.17) on Dec. 1, 1995 and now stands at 150 pence ($2.43), said the chairman.
"This in no way represents either our earning capacity or future prospects," he said.
"Hanson's profit in each of the last five years has comfortably exceeded 1 billion sterling ($1.6 billion) and this year's result shows clearly that the momentum continues."
Christopher Collins, Hanson vice chairman said in an interview that the market should take a longer view in judging the Hanson companies' value.
