GKN Plc, the UK auto-components group hit by a U.S. court verdict which awarded $398 million in damages to franchisees on Thursday, could see shares knocked further if the group fails to reverse the judgement through appealing, said analysts.
One analyst said that if the group failed to overturn the judgement or have the damages drastically cut, shares could fall by 6.6 percent from the last closing level of 1045 pence per share. Shares have already fallen three percent, or 35 1/2 pence, to 1009 1/2 so far this session.  
Another analyst saw shares falling 50 pence if the appeal by GKN is lost, but he was less pessimistic in his assessment.
He pointed out that "Yes, it is a shock for the market, but it is not significant to the operations of the company.
"If they lose there would be a large cash outflow and that could hit the value as a result of higher gearing. But it's a one-off scenario."
GKN has stated that under the worst case scenario the damages could be raised to $554 million on the basis that some parts of the claim are covered by the North Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act which allows for trebling of all penalties.
He said that even if the current damages were upheld and not raised, the impact on GKN's cash reservees would be serious.
He pointed out that GKN had 240-250 million pounds of free cash reserves which are unrelated to customer advance payments, "So if they had to pay the fine that would wipe out their cash balances and if they wanted to make an acquisition they would have to increase debt of make a rights issue," he said.
He added that the group was already "quite stretched, there is already an over-distribution on the dividend from a cash-flow perspective." The analyst has the company down as a "sell".
