China's largest zinc producer, Liuzhou Zinc Products Co, is tormented by water: there's either too much or too little.
The plant in the southern region of Guangxi struggles to stay open against fierce summer floods while low river water levels in winter often rob the factory of the hydropower it needs to keep its production lines running, officials said.
Average production at the plant fell to about 88 percent of capacity last year from a previous 95 percent after torrential summer rains flooded some 90 percent of the factory grounds, Jiang Wenjie, deputy director of the plant, said.
The high waters caused about 80 million yuan ($9.6 million) in damage and forced the closure of a zinc oxide production line for three months, Jiang told Reuters in an interview.
Damage from the floods has since been repaired and 1997 output will rise above last year's, he said.
"We see output of all our products hitting 95 percent of capacity this year," he said.
No visible traces remain of last year's floods but a recent tour of the factory grounds revealed workers standing idle because a power outage had shut down all production lines.
"This happens often in winter because water levels are too low to generate power," said one official, who asked not be identified.
The power outages had been worked into production plans, he said.
RISING PROFITS, SHARE LISTING SEEN IN 1997
Last year's floods had cut into the company's profits, which fell to an after-tax 10.32 million yuan last year on sales of 608 million yuan, Jiang said.
Profits were just half of those in 1995, Jiang said, but forecast they would rise to about 21 million yuan this year.
Sales were seen at 630 million yuan in 1997, he said.
The company's production of zinc ingots was seen hitting 33,200 tonnes in 1997 while output of zinc oxide would top 50,000 tonnes, he said.
"With the development of China's automobile and construction industries...the market for zinc oxide will increase gradually," he said.
China had some 40 plants turning out 170,000 tonnes of zinc oxide annually, he said, adding that domestic demand was about 130,000 tonnes a year.
The smelter's output of zinc alloys would hit 1,900 tonnes in 1997, output of zinc sulphate 3,800 tonnes and that of zinc powder about 1,700 tonnes, he said.
Production of lithopone, used in low-grade paints, would reach 28,500 tonnes but domestic demand was expected to slump as rising living standards fuelled the market for higher quality paints, he said.
Liuzhou Zinc had fixed assets of 250 million yuan, a registered capital of 101.5 million yuan and was 79.41 percent state-owned, Jiang said.
The firm had applied to list domestic currency A shares on the stock market in the southern town of Shenzhen, he said.
"We expect approval by the end of this year," he said but declined to give further details.
EXPORT TARIFF CUT NOT HELPFUL
Jiang gave a lukewarm welcome to a recent central government decision to cut zinc export tariffs in 1997.
Beijing's move to lower the temporary export tariff on zinc to zero in 1997 from 5.0 percent last year would have little effect on the plant's exports due to government quotas on the metal, Jiang said.
"Our exports won't be more than 20 percent of our output this year," he said.
That compared to exports of 45 percent of production in 1993, he said.
"There are still quotas on zinc exports," he said.
"The central government still has controls over the zinc industry," he said. "They want to ensure domestic demand is met."
EXPORTS TO GROW
The plant would export its products to 20 countries in 1997, he said.
Zinc oxide exports would head mainly to the United States, Japan, South Korea and southeast Asia, Jiang said but declined to give further details.
China produced about 1.07 million tonnes of zinc last year, down 0.32 percent from 1995, official figures show. Zinc output in December alone was 94,900 tonnes.
Domestic zinc demand is seen hitting 870,000 tonnes in 1997, up 6.1 percent from last year, the figures show.
The smelter sourced about 85 percent of its supply of zinc concentrate from mines in Guangxi, the southern province of Guangdong and Yunnan province in the southwest, he said.
The plant would not import zinc concentrate within the next five years, he said.
