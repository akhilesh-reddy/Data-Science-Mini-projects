When China's Chairman Mao Zedong died the news paralysed the nation, but 20 years later the passing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is mere office chatter in a country radically changed by his policies.
Some Chinese responded on Thursday to Deng's death with sadness and others with cold indifference. There was no great outpouring of grief of the kind that accompanied Mao's death in September, 1976.
When Mao died at age 82, weeping crowds poured out of factories and offices.
"It was like a family had lost its mother or the sky had collapsed," said a woman who was at high school then.
"We cried like we lost our father and mother," said a driver parked near Deng's residence in central Beijing. "Now everyone is indifferent."
Beijing announced six days of mourning for Deng, whose death at 92 on Wednesday closed the book on almost two decades of rule that transformed China into a budding economic powerhouse.
But in streets and offices it was business as usual, with no outward displays of grief. Street markets bustled and factories of the new economic powerhouse that Deng created hummed with activity.
"I am a little sad over Deng, but not shocked. People knew early on that Deng's health was poor," said a clerk bustling off to work.
"Deng doesn't measure up to the likes of Mao," said a 62-year-old sunflower seed vendor. "I don't care one bit about Deng's death."
Residents and political analysts said the greater freedom created by Deng's reformist economic policies changed the way Chinese regarded their leaders.
"This indicates people's attitudes towards the death of leaders has matured -- their minds are free," said a Chinese analyst who declined to be identified.
