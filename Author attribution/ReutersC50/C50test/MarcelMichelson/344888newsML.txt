France's Rhone-Poulenc SA said on Thursday its 1996 net income grew 28.4 percent to 2.74 billion francs ($494.9 million), but called this an insufficient level.
Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou denied market rumours the company was on the look-out for acquisitions, sought a merger or planned to split its chemicals and pharmaceuticals activities.
He told a news conference the group would focus on internal growth and he maintained his target of an increase in 1997 earnings per share of 20 percent, before exceptionals, from 8.44 francs in 1996.
Fourtou said the group would in 1997 exceed its planned two-year asset sale programme of 10 billion francs, which stood at 6.8 billion at the end of 1996, and would slash debt to below 50 percent of equity, from 61 in 1996 and 72 in 1995.
Sales were three percent higher at 85.82 billion francs and operating income rose 38.5 percent to 6.892 billion. The gross dividend was increased by 16.7 percent to 5.25 francs per share.
The profit figure was in line with analysts' expectations and Rhone-Poulenc shares closed 0.39 percent lower at 179.80 francs while the CAC-40 blue-chip index was up 1.54 percent.
"This is an encouraging figure, but it remains insufficient for a company of our size," Fourtou said about the profit.
He said there were three negative elements in the group's results -- the recall of albumin products at Centeon, a worldwide crisis in polyester which reduced operating income by 700 million francs, and a very low price of titanium oxide which had a 500 million franc negative impact.
Centeon is a 50-50 joint venture between Germany's Hoechst AG and Rhone's 68 percent-owned pharmaceuticals unit Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
Finance director Jean-Pierre Tirouflet said that while the negative effects would persist in the first quarter and perhaps first half of 1997, he saw an improvement in operating results of these activities.
Fourtou said that while improving profitablilty and cutting debt was his main priority, he dismissed rumours of a merger, split-up or capital increase.
"I can confirm we do not plan a major acquisition in 1997. We have never had so many opportunities for internal growth," he said. "I can also confirm that we have no plans for a capital increase, as is being rumored, nor do we envisage a de-merger."
He said later that his company was not interested in buying Elf Aquitaine's health and beauty unit Sanofi nor in linking up with this company.
"Firstly, as far as I understand, Sanofi is not for sale. But Elf has said it is willing to go below 50 percent," he said. "I want to make clear that we are not interested in an acquisition of Sanofi nor in a link-up with this company."
Fourtou added that while Rhone wanted better access to the Japanese and other Far Eastern markets, the company had dropped its previous goal of finding a Japanese takeover candidate and was now focusing on joint ventures.
