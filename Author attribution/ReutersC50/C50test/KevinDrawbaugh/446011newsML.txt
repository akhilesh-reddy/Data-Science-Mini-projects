Boehringer Mannheim Corp, a unit of privately held Corange Ltd, said data released Monday at an American College of Cardiology conference leveled the playing field between Boehringer and Genentech Inc in the market for clot-busting drugs to treat acute heart attack.
"What this study showed was comparability between the two products.... Essentially, at this point it will be a marketing fight," said Gregory Fulton, director of marketing for Boehringer's pharmaceuticals unit.  
Results from the GUSTO III study showed that Boehringer's Retavase did not save more lives than Genentech's Activase, better known as TPA, researchers reported. In the trial, 10,139 patients received Retavase, while 4,921 patients received TPA. Both drugs, as well as another called streptokinase, are commonly administered within six hours after a heart attack.
"Retavase...did not provide statistically significant benefit in 30-day mortality as compared to (TPA)," Genentech said in a statement released in conjunction with reporting of the data.  
As a result, Genentech said, Retavase failed to score the win which Boehringer had hoped for from the study -- proof that the drug is better than TPA, long the dominant drug in the field.
"We do not dispute that. The results were very clear," said Boehringer's Fulton. At the same time, he said, GUSTO III showed the two drugs to be roughly comparable and Boehringer is "very happy with that."
The researchers reported that the study's 30-day mortality rate was 7.43 percent for Retavase, versus 7.22 percent for TPA; total intracranial bleeding rate for Retavase was 0.91 percent and 0.88 percent for TPA; and total stroke rate for Retavase was 1.67 percent and 1.83 percent for TPA.
"GUSTO III reinforces the role (TPA) plays in savings lives every day," Genentech vice president of clinical research Dr. David Stump said in a statement.
