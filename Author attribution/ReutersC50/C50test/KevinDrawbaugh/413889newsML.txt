Health Care and Retirement Corp expects to maintain its rapid rate of profit growth and is open to a large strategic transaction if the right one comes along, its chief financial officer said on Monday.
In an interview with Reuters, Geoffrey Meyers said Health Care recorded earnings growth of more than 20 percent in every quarter since the company went public in 1991.  
"The $1.47 is 19 percent growth for this year. And 18 to 20 percent for the year after is something we've been giving guidance on," Meyers said.
The Toledo, Ohio-based company reported 1996 revenues of $782 million, versus 1995 revenues of $713.4 million.
"Our underlying growth rate in revenues is about 10 percent. We made an acquisition this year of a company called Milestone that will add another three, four percent. So we're up somewhere in the mid-teens this year in our revenue growth," he said.  
Regarding Wall Street speculation that Health Care &amp; Retirement may join in the merger wave sweeping through the nursing home and sub-acute care industry, Meyers said, "We certainly have the financial capability to do a large deal."
He said, "We would be interested in the right kind of large deal, but we're not just going to do one to do one."
