Diametrics Medical Inc plans to be profitable by the 1998 third quarter and generate revenues of $3.5 million this year, $8 million in 1997 and $18 million in 1998, said chief executive David Giddings.
"Our objective is to have our first profitable quarter in the third quarter of '98," Giddings said in an interview with Reuters at a Dain Bosworth conference here on Wednesday.
He said Diametrics -- a maker of hospital-bedside blood gas analysis systems -- has failed to deliver on its promises in the past, but he added, "That wasn't on my watch."  
Diametrics reported a 1995 year-end loss of $23 million.
The company expects to launch its new IRMA SL blood gas analyzer system this month. "The way the market should judge us is by what we do over the next three months," he said.
He added that the company has several options before it in the way of possible corporate alliances.
The IRMA is a portable, four-pound instrument that measures blood levels of oxygen, acidity, carbon dioxide, electrolytes and red blood cell volume much faster than competing systems requiring analysis to be done in the hospital laboratory.  
The SL version adds features not seen in older models.
Shares in Diametrics were up 3/8 at 5-1/4.
One year ago, Diametric shares traded as high as 12, but delays in delivering new products wrecked Wall Street forecasting models and the stock suffered.
Giddings started with six-year-old Diametrics in April after a management shake-up prompted by the company's failure to move beyond the research and development phase.
Shortly after arriving, Giddings pushed through an 18- percent workforce cut and said Wednesday he would not rule out the possibility of further cuts, depending on results.
The Roseville, Minn.-based company's work force now numbers 174 people, down from 223.
"We have a goal of being profitable in the third quarter of 1998 and we will do what it takes to hit that objective in terms of our cost base," Giddings said.
