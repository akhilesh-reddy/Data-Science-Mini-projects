By selling its Snapple beverage business for $300 million, Quaker Oats Co on Thursday both disappointed and relieved Wall Street.
The price was far lower than analysts following the company said they had hoped Quaker would be able to get.
"It was a fire-sale price.  I'd been using $600 to $700 million" as an estimated value for Snapple, said Prudential Securities food industry analyst John McMillin.
At the same time, analysts said they were relieved that Quaker was ending its disastrous Snapple venture.  
"The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back," said BT Securities food industry analyst John O'Neil.
Shares in Quaker were up 3/8 to 37-7/8 in late morning on heavy volume, after trading as high as 39-1/2.  Shares in Triarc Cos Inc, which is buying the Snapple line from Quaker, were up one to 16-3/4 after trading as high as 18.
Triarc owns the Mistic and Royal Crown beverage lines, as well as Arby's Inc fast-food restaurants and liquefied petroleum and specialty dyes and chemicals businesses.  
Chicago-based Quaker bought Snapple for $1.8 billion, including acquisition costs, two-and-a-half years ago near the height of the alternative beverage brand's popularity.
Since the purchase, widely seen by analysts as overvalued, Quaker has struggled with the line of ready-to-drink teas and juices.  Snapple sales declined eight percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, and the business ran at a cash loss, the company reported last month.
"The bad news is the (Snapple) investment's been a disaster; the good news is they're trying to put it behind them," McMillin said.
Quaker's other products include Gatorade, which continues to dominate the sports drink market, and cereals, such as Quaker oatmeals, Cap'n Crunch and Life.
"Quaker still has the crown jewels -- Gatorade and the cereals -- and performance in those businesses has been pretty good," said PaineWebber food industry analyst George Staphos.
