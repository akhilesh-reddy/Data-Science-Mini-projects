Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co chairman and chief executive L.D. DeSimone said the company is comfortable with 1997 earnings estimates ranging from $4.05 to $4.20 per share for 1997.
In an interview with Reuters Tuesday, DeSimone said, "Within that range, at this point in time, we feel that there's nothing different we should say."
Profits in 1996 were $3.63 per share.
DeSimone said the company is maintaining its target of earnings gains exceeding 10 percent annually.  
"Things can happen. The currency has gotten a lot worse," he said. "But we think that up to this point, we've had some mitigation of that with all sorts of programs. But there's a limit there, too. We feel pretty good about fulfilling those kinds of numbers."
In remarks to industry analysts also made Tuesday, 3M chief financial officer Giulio Agostini said about 1,000 employees in the United States and Europe late in the fourth quarter of 1996 left 3M through voluntary separation. "About an additional 500 people in Europe will depart 3M under similar programs in the first half of this year," he said.  
Agostini said St. Paul, Minn.-based 3M expects raw materials prices to be slightly lower in 1997 than in 1996, "producing a small benefit to cost of good sold."
He said capital spending for 1997 is expected to be about $1.3 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 1996.
The total shares outstanding of 3M is expected to be reduced by about four million in 1997 from its level at the end of 1996 of 416.8 million, Agostini said.
DeSimone said 30 percent of 3M's 1996 sales came from products introduced within the past four years, maintaining a traditional benchmark of the technology-based company.  
3M said 10 percent of 1996 sales came from products introduced within the past 12 months.
A more than 12-percent jump in fourth-quarter selling, general and administrative expense, compared to a jump for the entire year of only about half that, came on accounting adjustments and higher advertising costs, DeSimone said.
"We don't think that's continuing. What we see for SG&amp;A is a gradual decline to something a little under 25 percent of sales. We might get to that level over the next year, year-and-a-half," DeSimone said.
The company's effective tax rate was 35.0 percent for the fourth quarter and 35.8 percent for 1996, "slightly better than last year," Agostini said. "We don't anticipate a significant change in our tax rate in 1997," he said.
Shares in 3M were up 1-1/8 to 83-1/4 in late trading after the company reported fourth-quarter operating earnings of $0.90 per share, beating the First Call consensus estimate by $0.02. Earnings in the year-ago quarter were $0.63 per share on an operating basis.
"Volumes were encouragingly good. Margins were modestly weaker than I'd anticipated they might be relative to the revenue growth projection," said Schroder Wertheim analyst Michael Ellman. Overall, however, he said, "Aggregate volume growth was 12 percent. That's smoking. That's darn good."
