Pier 1 Imports is targeting earnings growth this year near the high end of its annual objective of 15 to 18 percent over the life of a five-year business plan, Chief Executive Clark Johnson said Wednesday.
"The Street has got us up toward the higher end of that range and I think we have an internal goal to do better than that, but that's an internal goal and it's not a forecast," Johnson told Reuters in an interview after a presentation to investors at a Raymond James conference here.  
Raymond James projects the retailer will report fiscal 1997 earnings of $1.25 per share, up 19 percent from $1.05 for fiscal 1996 ended February 28.
Johnson said Pier 1 projects sales this year will rise about $100 million. The company, which has 725 stores in North America plus joint ventures in England, Mexico and Japan, posted fiscal 1996 sales of $944.6 million.
He said the company will open 53 stores this year and close about 25. Remodeling and remerchandising of store layouts is also under way throughout much of the chain, reflecting a change in product lines, he said.  
At the end of its fiscal year last month, Pier 1 stopped selling apparel. It is beefing up its home furnishings offerings in response to what it sees as changing consumer attitudes. "The Martha Stewart syndrome is alive and well in America," Johnson said.
"There's been a shift in consumer spending away from apparel, and even in this past holiday season away from consumer electronics and toward home furnishings," he said.
Pier 1 is also launching a bridal registry program that Johnson said is expected to take further advantage of the trend toward higher sales of furniture, fixtures and other items for the home.
The company operates a joint venture in England called "The Pier." Johnson said it is expected to break even this year after losing money last year.
He said expansion in Japan continues. "We think it's possible to eventually have about 200 stores in Japan," he said.
