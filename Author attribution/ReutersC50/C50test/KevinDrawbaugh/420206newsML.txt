Biogen Inc expects to begin European marketing of Avonex, a multiple sclerosis drug, within the next 30 days and expects European sales eventually to match U.S. sales, President and Chief Operating Officer James Tobin said Wednesday.
At a Raymond James investors conference here, Tobin said, "I would expect we'll be on the European market within the next 30 days ... Ultimately, I would expect that our sales in Europe would approach our level of sales in the U.S."  
Avonex sales in 1996 totalled $76.5 million. Biogen's total 1996 sales were $277 million, up from $151.7 million in 1995. Biogen launched U.S. sales of Avonex -- the biotechnology pioneer's first major proprietary product -- in May 1996. Its sales have greatly boosted the company's revenue stream, previously comprised chiefly of royalties for hepatitis B vaccines and alpha interferon patents licensed to large pharmaceutical companies.  
Avonex reduces the frequency and severity of multiple sclerosis flares and competes with Schering AG's Betaseron, as well as the recently approved Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.
Biogen plans to expand revenues and earnings by selling more Avonex and getting it approved for uses other than multiple sclerosis, in addition to out-licensing other technologies, Tobin said.
Biogen hopes to soon out-license Hirulog, a blood-thinning agent. "We have found someone who is interested," Tobin said.
The company also has new possible products in the pipeline, including a renal disorder treatment called OP-1, which is being developed jointly with Creative BioMolecules Inc , as well as other compounds.
"The point is that Biogen is not a one-drug story," Tobin said.
