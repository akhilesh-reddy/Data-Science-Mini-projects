Lufthansa Cargo said there is good demand for air freight services between Germany and China because mainland companies are rushing to beat a year end deadline for import tax changes, the airline's managing director for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Christian Sedelmaier has told Reuters.
In an interview, he said many joint venture companies are rushing to import machinery because it is tax exempt until the end of December. Leading German companies such as Volkswagen and Siemens are importing large amounts of industrial machinery into China via Lufthansa Cargo, Sedelmaier said.
"Because of the change, there is a rush for additional transportation requirements on our flights to China. Capacity until the end of the year is insufficient to meet demand. Companies have now missed the deadline to send machinery by sea so we are benefitting by that and also trying to arrange charter flights if possible," Sedelmaier said.
He also said demand for air freight in general in China will continue to grow with the 'just in time' concept becoming increasingly widespread in China.
Lufthansa Cargo said it currently offers one dedicated freighter service a week between Frankfurt, Beijing and Shanghai. It also offers additional cargo capacity on daily Lufthansa passenger flights and on five flights per week in a cooperation agreement with Air China. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
