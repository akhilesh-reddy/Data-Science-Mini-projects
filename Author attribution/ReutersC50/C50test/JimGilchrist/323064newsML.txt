A Hong Kong government aircraft is to be the first to land at the territory's new Chek Lap Kok airport next month, a Civil Aviation Department spokesman told Reuters.
A Beechcraft Super King 200, belonging to the Government Flying Service, and normally used for search and rescue missions, is due to make the maiden landing on February 20, the spokesman said.
Initial reports said two American pilots flying a U.S. government Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) jet used to test the new airport's navigation instruments would be the first to land on the newly completed 3,800 metre long and sixty metres wide southern runway.
But for "ceremonial" reasons the spokesman said the honour will be given to Hong Kong government pilots watched by invited guests and the media.
"The first landing will be an important milestone in the airport's history," the spokesman said.
After the first flight, the specialised FAA aircraft is expected to start a test and calibration programme of the new airport's Instrument Landing System and navigation aids to prepare for the airport's opening in April next year, the spokesman added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44-171-542-5017
