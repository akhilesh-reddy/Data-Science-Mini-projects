Cathay Pacific Airways Limited said it welcomed the go- ahead for a second runway at Manchester airport.
"Although Cathay is not looking to increase frequency into Manchester in the near future, a second runway will give us the chance to optimise arrival and departure timings in the medium term," a Cathay spokeswoman told Reuters.
Cathay currently has daily flights to the north west of England airport via Amsterdam, Frankfurt or Paris. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+5017
