Air Canada's president and chief executive officer, Lamar Durrett, has expressed his frustration at being repeatedly denied permission by the Canadian government to begin daily flights from Vancouver and Toronto to Hong Kong.
Air Canada said it finally began its Hong Kong to Vancouver link last December but was currently limited to four flights per week. It also wanted to compete with Cathay Pacific Airways Limite from Canada's biggest hub in Toronto.
Cathay currently dominates the Hong Kong-Canada non-stop route with 21 flights per week to Vancouver, Toronto and on to New York. National rival Canadian Airlines International has nine non-stop flights a week to its Vancouver hub from Hong Kong.
Speaking to reporters after a speech to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, Durrett said the Canadian government had repeatedly refused to reconsider the bilateral agreement and allow daily services to Hong Kong from both Vancouver and Toronto by Air Canada.
He agreed the airline was hamstrung and making no headway in breaking the impasse despite a continuing lobbying campaign.
"I can assure you the minister of transport, the cabinet and the prime minister are aware of Air Canada's desires and ambitions," Durrett said.
When asked when a breakthrough might be expected, Durrett said: "We will continue our lobbying effort but it is very difficult to say. The only indication we have had from Ottawa is that we would probably get the increase when the new airport opens (at Chek Lap Kok due in April 1998)," he added.
Air Canada currently uses Boeing 747 Combi aircraft on the Hong Kong route but Durrett ruled out increasing passenger capacity by using a Boeing 747-400, saying a daily service was the solution.
