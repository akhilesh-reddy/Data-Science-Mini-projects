Hong Kong's Airport Authority, which is being pressured by the world's airlines not to impose much higher fees at the territory's new airport, said it will reveal the estimated level of charges early in the new year.
An Authority spokesman told Reuters that it was "premature to speculate" what the level of charges at Chek Lap Kok would be.
"The Authority is still looking at its future charges in consultation with the airlines and the government. The estimated level of charges will be available early in the new year and will then go before the Civil Aviation Department and the Executive Council for approval," the spokesman said. He said he could not give an exact date when the charges would be published.
On Monday the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said it was dismayed by rumours of drastically increases up to four times the current charges at Kai Tak airport.
An IATA official estimated last month that this would mean a Boeing 747 would have to pay US$12,000 every time it landed at Chep Lap Kok. This compares to the existing most expensive landing fee of US$9,000 at Osaka's Kansai airport.
IATA also said revenues raised from the proposed redevelopment of Kai Tak should be used to offset the cost of using Chek Lap Kok. Hong Kong's new US$10 billion airport and associated infrastructure projects is due to open in April 1998.
A spokeswoman for Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department said it was too soon to comment on future landing fees.
Regarding using money raised from the redevelopment of Kai Tak to offset charges at the new airport, she said a decision on the old airport's future use would not be made until after the Chinese handover next summer.
