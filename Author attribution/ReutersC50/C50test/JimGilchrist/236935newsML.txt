Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) said it has set a new handling record of 5,700 tonnes in one day.
HACTL managing director Anthony Charter also told Reuters that initial figures showed there had been a total throughput of 150,000 tonnes during November, representing a 16 percent increase in year-on-year growth.
November's export growth was 18 percent and imports increased 12.8 percent, he added.
But growth for the year is expected to be no more than five to six percent, Charter said.
"The new daily record at the end of October of 5,700 tonnes is very pleasing and signifies a pick up in the market during October and November. It has been a very strong peak season this year," Charter said in an interview.
HACTL, which has a monopoly on all air cargo handling at Kai Tak airport, is jointly owned by Swire Aviation Ltd, Jardine Matheson, Wharf (Holdings) Ltd, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, China National Aviation Corp and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.
