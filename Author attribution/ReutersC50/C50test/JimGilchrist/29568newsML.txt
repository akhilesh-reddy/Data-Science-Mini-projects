Cargo airlines may fly elsewhere if the cost of using Hong Kong's new airport is dramatically increased, the Orient Airlines Association (OAA) director-general Richard Stirland said.
Stirland, speaking from Manila, told Reuters he is alarmed at reports that charges may double when Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok replaces Kai Tak in 1998.
The OAA  represents 16 of the major carriers in Asia including Singapore Airlines Ltd, Japan Airlines Co Ltd, Thai Airways International Ltd and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd,
Stirland said some airlines - especially cargo carriers - may bypass Hong Kong for cheaper alternatives nearby such as Macau, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
"You may get a situation as in Europe where freighter operators don't need to go to Heathrow or Paris-Charles de Gaulle and use smaller, cheaper alternatives instead," he added.
It currently costs around US$24,000 for a two hour stop in Hong Kong compared to $23,000 at Singapore's Changi, he said.
The new Hong Kong Airport Authority has said charges will "inevitably rise" but added that reports that they will double are "pure speculation."
A spokeswoman said it will not be until early next year how that a decision will be taken on how much it will cost after the airlines have been consulted.
The charges will then have to be approved by Hong Kong's Director of Civil Aviation.
A spokesman for one of the major users of the new airport, Hong Kong's de facto flag carrier Cathay Pacific said it is concerned at price rises which would have to be passed on to airline passengers and cargo customers.
"There is a big concern about fees rising which would damage all airlines and Hong Kong as a regional hub. Ultimately we could not absorb that sort of increase which would be passed onto our customers," Kwan Chuk-fai said.
"We will be seeking a meeting with the authority but so far no date has been fixed," he added. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017
