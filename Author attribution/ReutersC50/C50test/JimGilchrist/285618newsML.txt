Hong Kong's air cargo workers are to pioneer a "unique" computerised rota system later this year, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) deputy managing director Yueng Kwok Keung said.
The new system should enable HACTL to further improve its air cargo handling efficiency, Yueng told Reuters in an interview.
"It's a pretty unique system which we're helping to develop and is likely to be delivered to us in the middle of this year. We're expected to be the first to use it," Yueng said.
When introduced, HACTL's 2,000 employees will be able to have a big say on which shifts they work, who they work alongside and which days off they can have.
Rostering is a particularly difficult problem in the air cargo industry which, despite high automation, relies on intensive labour where workloads change from day to day, he added.
"The new system is democratic where every worker is given a set number of points so he can bid to have a certain day off for his wife's birthday or if he wants to work nights or whatever. It can also help with team formation," Yueng explained.
The rostering system is the result of a joint venture between business and academia. Funded by the Hong Kong government, research has been carried out at Hong Kong's Chinese University for the past year with HACTL computer experts closely involved, he added.
Yueng said he thinks the new system can be adapted in other industries with complicated work patterns. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017
