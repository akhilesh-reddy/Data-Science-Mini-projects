Northwest Airlines Cargo freighters have been averaging 96.7 percent utilisation on ex-Hong Kong flights during a "difficult but interesting" past 12 months, the airline's cargo sales and marketing manager in Hong Kong, Alexander Wong said.
He told Reuters in an interview that 38,000 tonnes of cargo had been moved to and from Hong Kong on Northwest's trans-Pacific routes which had seen unusual highs and lows over the past year.
Wong said Northwest had experienced in February and March the slowest months and in October and November the busiest months for several years.
"We are now looking at more or less the same volume as last year. 1996 was not as healthy as 1994 and 1995. The first three months of the year were unexpectedly slow for us and we lost US$6 million and eight million pounds of freight. The business just was not there, regardless of the price we were charging. We have always been trying to catch up since then," Wong said.
"Yield has picked up a little bit over the past two months but is still way below the 1995 level, I would say 8-10 per cent below," Wong added.
Northwest said it is the largest U.S. trans-Pacific carrier offering daily passenger flights and six freighters a week from Hong Kong to the U.S. via Tokyo Narita.
