British Airways World Cargo plans to increase its wet lease freighter service between Hong Kong and London to a daily frequency when the territory's new airport opens next year, the airline's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan, has told Reuters.
BA is also planning to step up its three times a week freighter link from Hong Kong to London Gatwick to four times weekly later this year, Chan said in an interview.
It now operates Boeing 747-200 freighters wet leased from Atlas Air in addition to sizeable belly capacity aboard 14 Boeing 747-400 passenger flights a week to Heathrow.
Wet leasing involves the supply of an aircraft with crew, fuel, supplies and supporting services.
The proposed daily freighter service from Hong Kong could be switched to Heathrow where BA is building a new dedicated terminal provided suitable slots become available, Chan added.
"We are hoping to start the fourth weekly frequency late this summer and a daily service from next year as we continue to expand. Three years ago we started with zero now we have three freighters a week with the prospect of more to come," Chan said.
BA said it currently enjoys a 12 percent market share of shipments from Hong Kong to Europe and 45 per cent to the UK and Ireland.
