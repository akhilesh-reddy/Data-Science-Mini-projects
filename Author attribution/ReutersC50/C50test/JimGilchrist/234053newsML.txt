Air Canada said it is making a profit on its Hong Kong-Vancouver route which celebrates its first year of operations this month.
Speaking to reporters after a speech to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the airline's president and chief executive officer, Lamar Durrett, said the airline carried 34,000 passengers, had an average load factor of 65 percent with projected passenger revenue until year end of Canadian $192 million during the first year.
On cargo, Durrett said 4.7 million kilos were carried with cargo revenue at just under C$12 million. 47 percent of ex Hong Kong cargo was destined for Canada, 53 percent went to U.S. via Toronto, he added.
"The Hong Kong route is running at a profit," Durrett said.
Air Canada started the Hong Kong -Vancouver route on December 20 last year using Boeing 747 Combi aircraft and now flies four times a week, officials said.
Dave Tangry, general manager cargo sales for Asia Pacific said summer weather conditions during July and August, including headwinds and hot temperatures, had sometimes severely restricted the Combi's normal 40 tonnes cargo payload to as little as three tonnes cargo payload.
Earlier, Air Canada's president said he expects Hong Kong's role as a funnel for half of China's exports and as a regional business and export centre to grow and that cargo is a key component in the airline's Asia Pacific strategy.
