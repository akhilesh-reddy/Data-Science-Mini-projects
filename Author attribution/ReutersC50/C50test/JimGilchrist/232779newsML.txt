Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) has taken delivery of a new Boeing 747-400 freighter, an airline spokesman has told Reuters.
The new arrival brings SIA's cargo fleet to five 747-400 and one 747-200 freighter which is expected to be replaced by a sixth 747-400 in March next year, the spokesman added.
SIA's latest 747 freighter flew into Singapore's Changi airport on November 27 and is due to make its first revenue earning flight to San Francisco and Los Angeles at a date yet to be announced.
It will then be used on all SIA's cargo routes worldwide, the spokesman added. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017
