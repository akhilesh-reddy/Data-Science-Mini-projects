A electronic document language translator is expected to be commercially available within 18 months which will offer "tremendous" benefits for the air cargo industry, an electronic commerce specialist has told Reuters.
The market development director for Hong Kong information processing firm CargoNet, Edi Leong, said the translator will mean a shopfloor worker in China will be able to read in Chinese a purchase order received from an American company in English and vice-versa.
"That will be a tremendous benefit to business and greatly speed things up because you automate the whole process and actually get down to the working level," Leong told Reuters in an interview.
"We are about 12-18 months away from it being commercially available. People all over the world have been working on a translator for a long time and some universities have developed a working model. There is an awful lot of work to be done but it's not too far off and the benefits will be out of this world when it comes," Leong added.
Industry observers say there are tremendous difficulties in developing a Chinese to English translator because of the number and complexity of the characters and not every English word has a Chinese equivalent but agree the potential benefits are huge.
Among CargoNet's shareholders is sea container specialists Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT) which is part of the Hutchison Group and Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents (HAFFA). - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
