Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL) is busy handling one of its most difficult and dangerous cargoes - live snakes, HACTL's general operations manager, Tony Morris said.
As Hong Kong temperatures dip, up to five tons of mainly cobras and pit vipers are daily arriving by air to become snake soup, snake stew and snake wine. Rows of wire baskets outside restaurants are full of snakes awaiting their fate.
The Chinese swear by the medicinal qualities of snake gall bladder cut out of a live snake and swigged down with a glass of brandy to ward off winter flu as well as other snake delicacies, Morris told Reuters in an interview.
But the snakes pose a particular handling problem for the Hong Kong authorities as they are sometimes used to smuggle drugs, Morris explained. A popular method of smuggling heroin is to drug the snake with smoke, make a small cut in its skin and sew the heroin inside.
All snake imports from breeding farms in Thailand and mainland China are scrutinised by hand in two specially equipped inspection rooms at HACTL. The brown hessian sacks packed in wooden crates with breathing holes are dumped into a big wire basket from which each snake is pulled to be carefully examined for hidden contraband.
"It wouldn't be everyone's favourite occupation but the customs officers treat it as an everyday job and actually seem to enjoy it," Morris said. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
