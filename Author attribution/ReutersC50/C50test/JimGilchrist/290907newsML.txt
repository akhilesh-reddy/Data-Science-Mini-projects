Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) said it set four new handling records during the territory's pre-Christmas peak season in December.
HACTL managing director Anthony Charter told Reuters that imports were especially strong when new daily, weekly and monthly records were set.
A new daily import handling record of 2,661 tonnes was set on December 26, according to HACTL's performance records.
"The daily tonnage record (for the after Christmas) is most unusual. Imports into China have been very strong, noticeably machinery," Charter said.
A new weekly import record of 15,720 tonnes was also recorded between December 16 and 22.
December as a whole was also a record month for imports with 67,572 tonnes landing at Kai Tak airport.
December 15 also saw a new daily record being set for both imports and exports combined of 5,788 tonnes, HACTL figures show.
Charter said HACTL's long range forecast is for 8 per cent growth this year and he personally thinks it may reach 10 per cent.
"We have all been surprised by the trends of the last three or four months and there is not much to indicate a slowdown for the next six months," Charter added.
HACTL, which has a monopoly on all air cargo handling at Kai Tak airport, is jointly owned by Swire Aviation Ltd, Jardine Matheson, Wharf (Holdings) Ltd, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, China National Aviation Corp and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
