Australia's flag carrier Qantas Airways Ltd is expected to post a flat result for the six months ended December 31, 1996, as a higher Australian dollar and higher fuel charges keep profits under pressure.
Analysts contacted by Reuters expected Qantas to report on Thursday a pre-abnormal net profit of between A$116 million and A$154 million with most estimates around A$148 million.
Qantas, which is 25 percent owned by British Airways Plc, reported a pre-abnormal net profit of A$148.1 million in the 1995/96 first half.  
All analysts agreed that the Qantas results would be largely affected by the higher Australian dollar and increased jet fuel price. The local dollar hit a six-year high of US$0.8215 in December, but was back around US$0.7650 on Tuesday afternoon.
"On the international side, there will be some yield pressure compounded by the stronger Australian dollar," said one Sydney-based aviation analyst, who forecast a net profit before abnormals of A$154 million for the first half.
"On the domestic side there will be some yield pressure but they have managed to increase their market share," he said.
Qantas' cost cutting programme was seen helping the shield the airline from a lower profit.
"I would not be forecasting an increase in profit if it wasn't for the cost cutting," the analyst said.
Qantas increased its cost cutting target by A$100 million to A$430 million in 1996/97 in November after cutting A$468 million out of costs in the 1995/96 year.
J.B Were &amp; Son aviation analyst Justin Arter forecasts Qantas to post a pre-abnormal net profit of A$148 million.
Analysts expect Qantas keep the half year dividend steady at 6.5 cents a share.
However, another Sydney-based analyst, who also asked not to be identified, forecast Qantas to report a pre-abnormal net profit of A$116 million for the half, citing currency and higher jet fuel prices as impacting on the first half result.
Paul Xavier, aviation analyst at broker BNP Equities, expected Qantas to report a lower pre-abnormal net profit of A$141 million for the six month period.
"There has been a bit of a lag effect between the costs increasing and the ability to pass that on through increased fares to passengers," said Xavier, referring to his profit forecast.
Qantas increased local fares in the second half of 1996.
A Melbourne-based aviation analyst forecast Qantas to report a pre-abnormal net profit of A$152.4 million for the half.
Generally, conditions were expected to be better ofr Qantas in the second half.
"Hopefully fuel prices will come back a little bit and the second half will be stronger," the Melbourne analyst said.
He added the falling Australian dollar should also help the second half result.
The Australian dollar is currently trading over US$0.7600.

Analysts were also mixed on their views Qantas share price, which has risen about 17 percent since the end of November. Some said it was a hold, while others said it still held good value.
