Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd chief executive officer Neil Gamble said on Monday he expected to get a long awaited tax break for high spending gamblers from the New South Wales (NSW) government soon.
"I expect an imminent decision from the government and I am quite confident that they will give the go ahead for a favourable tax regime," Gamble told Reuters in an interview.
Gamble said the NSW state government had told him they would be making their decision in the first quarter of 1997.
