Building materials group Boral Ltd is expected to report a lower net profit before abnormals for the six months to December 31 on Wednesday, but the results should show signs of an improving housing market, analysts said.
Building material analysts contacted by Reuters forecast Boral to report a pre-abnormal net profit of between A$89 million and A$93 million for the 1996/97 half year, compared with A$120 million a year earlier.
Analysts said although the first half was likely to be down on a year ago it should be up on the 1995/96 second half.  
BZW Australia building material analyst Greg Burns forecasts Boral to report a pre-abnormal net profit of A$89 million for the December half.
"Non-residentials are as strong as an ox, and it has been for many quarters, and housing, as far as approvals are concerned, bottomed in September," Burns told Reuters.
"I just think the six months to December will not have enough good news in it to get too excited," Burns said.
ANZ Securities building materials analyst Sean Cooney estimates Boral to report a pre-abnormal net profit of A$93 million for the six month period.  
Cooney said Australian building material companies had been reporting disappointing results for some time and Boral was unlikely to any exception.
Last week Pioneer International Ltd reported a 18.3 percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half.
"Things have looked worst than some people have expected in Australia's housing market and because Boral has got a fairly significant exposure compared to the others, you expect it to be a bit more worse hit then the others," Cooney told Reuters.
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett analyst Fabian Babich forecast a net profit before abnormals of A$90 million for the first half.  
Merrill Lynch building materials analyst Michael Brown forecast a first half pre-abnormal net profit of A$90 million.
John North at J.B. Were &amp; Son also estimated Boral to report a pre-abnormal net profit of A$90 million.
Analysts said they expected Boral to pay a first half dividend of 7.5 cents.
In November, Boral said it would maintain a 7.5 cents per share dividend for the December half, the same amount it paid in the 1995/96 second half.
Boral paid a 10.5 cents dividend in the 1995/96 first half.  
Although analysts were in a narrow range for the first half result, forecasts for the 1996/97 full year varied from A$163.8 million to A$190 million for pre-abnormal net profit.
Boral reported a net profit before abnormals of A$170.9 million for the year to June 30, 1996.
Shares in the Sydney-based group have traded in a range between A$2.91 and A$3.70 since June 1996, when they were around A.
At 1.45 p.m. (0245 GMT), Boral shares were two cents lower at A$3.48.
