The long-awaited turnaround in Australia's housing market is expected to occur during 1997 but it is unlikely to signal a repeat of the boom seen in the 1980s or the most recent peak in the 1993/94 year.
Lower immigration levels Australia are seen as a major reason for the subdued demand for housing, analysts said.
However the anticipated housing recovery would be welcomed by building material companies, hardware chains and consumer goods manufacturers, who have blamed the recent housing slump for a fall in profits over the past 18 months.  
House construction is expected to total 127,200 homes in the 1996/97 year to June 30, up from 124,550 a year earlier, according to the government's housing forecaster, the Indicative Planning Council (IPC).
However this forecast is in doubt, according to building industry body, the Master Builders Association (MBA), which has said total building approvals needed to rise by around 17 percent to meet the 1996/97 forecast.
The 1996/97 forecast is well down on the 182,000 homes built in the 1993/94 high point and the 177,000 level reached in the previous peak in 1988/89.  
IPC forecasts housing starts to average 138,000 a year to the 1999/2000 year.In the three years to 1993/94 homes built averaged 177,000 per year.
"The markets won't take off without a substantial push from overseas migration, which of course is not particularly popular at the moment," said Jim Sibree, property consultant at consultancy BIS Shrapnel.
Australia has been caught-up in a debate over immigration started last year by independent politician Pauline Hanson whose call in September for a freeze on immigration appears to have struck a chord with many voters.  
The Australian government expects to take in about 86,000 immigrants during 1996/97, down from 96,000 in 1995/96 and well below the levels taken in the 1980s when the intake averaged between 130,000 and 140,000 a year.
The number of people leaving Australia has averaged between 27,000 and 30,000 over the past decade.
Overseas migration is seen as the major determinant of growth of the housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities, both with populations of over three million.  
"Migration would have to go through the 100,000 level before it could give a major boost to the Sydney and Melbourne markets," Sibree told Reuters.
Australia has taken about 5.5 million immigrants since the end of World War Two, representing almost a quarter of the nation's current population of 18 million.
The government current population projection is about 23 million in 30 years.  
Christianna Cobbold, executive director of policy at the , Housing Industry Association (HIA) said the Australian housing market was unlikely to repeat the growth it recorded over the past 20 years, since the end of the "White Australia Policy."
"In the longer term I don't think we are going to see the massive growth we have seen in the past 15 or 20 years. We just don't have that sort of population growth," Cobbold said.
Cobbold said the HIA plans a study into the effects of immigration on Australia on economic, social and cultural levels. The study is expected to be completed by mid-1997.
