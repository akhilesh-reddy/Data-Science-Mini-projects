Barrick Gold Corp said on Wednesday it was now the world's second largest gold producer, supplanting Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.
Barrick's 1996 gold production was 3,148,801 ounces, surpassing Gold Fields' 3,125,631 ounces for fiscal 1996. Barrick expects 1997 production to top three million ounces again.
The Toronto-based company posted a 40 percent increase in its proven and probable reserves to 51 million ounces from 36.5 million ounces. Barrick also reported 25 million ounces of gold in the resource category -- gold not fully proven yet.
Barrick has made no secret of its ambition to become the world's largest gold company, surpassing Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.
To clinch first place, Barrick is seeking control of the huge Busang deposit in Indonesia, said to be one of this century's most sensational gold discoveries.
Two new mines will also likely carry Barrick closer to its leadership goal. Drilling at Barrick's Pierina property in Peru expanded reserves there to 6.5 million ounces so far, Barrick said. The mine is expected to come into production in late 1999 at an annual rate of 500,000 ounces of gold.
Drilling at Barrick's Pascua mine in Chile bumped reserves to 10 million ounces so far, with 6.7 million ounces identified in the reserve category. The mine is scheduled to start production of 400,000 ounces a year by the year 2000.
Barrick has been negotiating with Calgary's Bre-X Minerals Ltd for months to control the Busang discovery, but Barrick's chances of success are up in the air.
"One of the messages they'll probably try to get across is that they are not desperate for it, they certainly don't need it, they have an awful lot already," said gold analyst Catherine Gignac with Deacon Capital in Toronto.
Barrick also said today that its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings fell, due mainly to higher operating and exploration costs. Fourth-quarter profit declined to US$56 million or US$0.15 a share from year earlier US$78 million or US$0.22 a share.
Full-year earnings declined to US$218 million or US$0.60 a share from US$292 million or US$0.82 a share in 1995.
Barrick was down 0.40 to 35.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in afternoon trading on Wednesday and by 3/8 to 26-1/2 in New York.
