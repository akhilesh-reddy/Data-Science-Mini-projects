Canada is raising the amount of investment required of prospective immigrants seeking to settle in the country, Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard said on Friday.
Under a program designed to attract investment, one way foreigners seeking to live in Canada may be granted an immigrant visa is by pledging to invest in the economy.
But Robillard told a news conference the required amount would be raised to avoid abuse and to ensure adequate economic impact.
"While we won't be changing the basic selection criteria for investor entry to Canada, we will be changing the amounts needed to invest, the ways in which that capital can be used and the way in which the program is administered," she said.
"It's the most practical way to ensure growth and employment at the local level."
She denied that passage into Canada was for sale. "Our citizenship is not for sale in this country," she said. "The amount of money invested is not the only criteria here."
Investors account for about three percent of total immigration to Canada each year. Currently they must invest $250,000 Canadian ($180,000) to gain entry.
That is being raised to C$450,000 ($325,000) for the richest, most popular destinations -- Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. For the rest of Canada the rate will rise to C$350,000 ($250,000).
At least 60 percent of the capital must be invested in small and medium-sized businesses. The provinces will be able to direct the remaining 40 percent to their chosen priorities.
The immigrant investor program was introduced in 1986 to attract experienced business people and their money to Canada. The program has attracted C$3.75 billion ($2.74 billion) since its inception and created more than 33,000 jobs, Robillard said.
