Canadian grocery chain Loblaw Cos Ltd is set to see earnings per share soar by 50 percent by 2000 as sales grow, President Richard Currie said on Friday.
"Earnings per share will jump about 50 percent over the next three years," Currie told the annual meeting. First- quarter profit rose to C$0.15 a share for the period ended March 22 from year earlier C$0.12.
Currie also told shareholders that 1997 earnings per share would rise to C$0.85 to C$0.89, the range of predictions by analysts. "My expectations are (that) the analysts are about correct," he said.
Last year, Loblaw, which is 70 percent-owned by bakery group George Weston Ltd, earned C$0.72 a share or C$173.7 million on sales of C$9.85 billion.
Currie forecast 1997 sales would expand by 10 percent. "Sales have been very solid, up seven percent last year, and with this year being a 53-week year, it might hit to 10 percent," Currie added. "That would represent a stellar year."
Loblaw ended its previous fiscal year in December 28 but because it reports in 12-week increments, it must add a few days this year.
"The earnings have a potential to increase more if we can get our costs down to where they could be," Currie said. In 1996, Loblaw streamlined warehousing and distribution systems.
Loblaw, which owns retail and wholesale stores including Loblaws, Valu-Mart, Extra Foods and Lucky Dollar Foods, has seen sales grow steadily over the past few years as it expanded in Atlantic Canada and other regions.
The grocer plans to unveil its first Quebec stores, outside of its outlets in the Ottawa/Hull region, in late 1997 or early 1998.
Loblaw has also benefited from the strike of unionized workers at 73 Safeway Inc stores in Alberta, which began on March 26, Currie added. Loblaw sales have jumped 30 percent in the province.
Safeway is based in Pleasanton, California.
Currie said Loblaw would have C$450 million in capital expenditures in 1997, up from about C$350 million in 1996. He said Loblaw planned to open or renovate 64 outlets.
Loblaw shares edged up 0.05 to 17.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange today, below its 52-week high of 17.60 and well above its year low of 10.40.
George Weston shares rose 0.50 to 78 in Toronto.
