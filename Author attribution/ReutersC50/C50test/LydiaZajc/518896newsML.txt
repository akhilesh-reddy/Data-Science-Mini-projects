Toronto stocks gained nearly one percent on Wednesday, powered by a rally in the conglomerate and banking groups as investors cheered strong first quarter earnings.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index climbed 55.27 points to close at 5789.82.
Trading was moderate with turnover of 78.9 million shares worth C$1.27 billion ($909 million).
"I think this surprised a few people," said ScotiaMcLeod senior vice-president Fred Ketchen. "The overriding influence in the market is moving away from inflationary problems to satisfaction with earnings," he said.
Toronto and New York have corrected about 10 percent since mid-March amid fears of further U.S. interest rate hikes.
But investors have put those concerns aside as companies report stronger-than-expected earnings, Ketchen said.
Canadian steel maker Stelco Inc on Wednesday posted first quarter earnings of C$0.27 ($0.19) a share compared to C$0.13 ($0.09) a share in the same period a year ago.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 11 gained ground led by consumer products, banks and conglomerates. The three weak sectors were media, real estate and golds.
"The expectation is that the banks are going to have another year of record earnings," Ketchen said.
Advancing issues edged out declines 482 to 468 while another 285 stocks traded flat.
In individual stocks, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. continued to attract attention, slipping 0.06 to 2.17 on 3.9 million shares. Bre-X was the most-active stock of the session.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest bank, jumped 1.20 to 53.05 on 2.8 million shares.
Gold producer Placer Dome Inc. fell 0.35 to 23.05 on 1.6 million shares ahead of an announcement by Crystallex International Corp.
Crystallex was expected to make an announcement regarding its effort to claim a part of Placer Dome's Las Cristinas gold property in Venezuela, analysts said.
Crystallex gained 0.81 to 4.01 before the stock was halted pending news on Wednesday.
