Toronto stocks closed weaker on Wednesday, hit by the wave of selling after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan questioned whether equity prices could sustain their strong two-year growth spurt.
"It's bearish for stocks," said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index recouped some of its early losses, but still closed down 46.35 points at 6201.43.
Greenspan also expressed concern about the risks of inflation and warned the Fed may need to hike interest rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank about 120 points during the session, but finished the day off 55.03 points at 6983.18.
Greenspan sparked a similar sell off in December after he remarked on the "irrational exuberance" of the stock market, but North American markets later recovered.
"We're going to continue to get this kind of sell off and bargain hunting," Beattie said.
Wednesday's trading was brisk at 104.9 million shares worth C$1.88 billion ($1.37 billion).
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices tumbled, led by golds, transportation, consumer products and base metals.
Declining issues outnumbered advances 595 to 408 while another 287 stocks traded flat.
