Toronto stocks ended weaker on Thursday, extending Wednesday's sharp losses despite a strong rally in heavyweight gold issues.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index lost 13.97 points to finish at 6187.46. The key index fell 46 points on Wednesday.
"It would have been a lot worse if not for the gain in gold," said International MMS analyst Katherine Beattie.
Toronto's gold and precious metals group soared 2.85 percent after bullion prices rose in both London and New York metal markets.
Trading was brisk with 114.9 million shares changing hands worth C$2.04 billion ($1.5 billion).
North American markets on Thursday continued to digest the negative comments on stock prices made by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday.
Greenspan cautioned that the stock markets might be overvalued and the risk of rising inflation could prompt a tightening in short-term interest rates.
"I think people are taking Greenspan's comments seriously," Beattie said.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 11 groups lost ground led by media, utilities, conglomerates and transportation. The three strong sectors were golds, base metals and real estate.
Declining issues outnumbered advances 520 to 472. Another 289 traded flat.
Telecommunications conglomerate BCE Inc. fell 2.30 to 66.90 on 4.3 million shares, topping Toronto's most active list.
BCE, Canada's largest publicly-traded company, was beaten up by investors after unit Bell Canada said its 1997 profits will fall short of preliminary targets set in March 1995.
Bell Canada said late Wednesday that net income will reach C$850 million ($620 million), down from a previous forecast of C$950 million ($695 million). Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday it may downgrade the ratings of Bell Canada and its parent.
Among rallying gold stocks, Barrick Gold Corp. rose 1.65 to close at 38.35 on 1.7 million shares.
Placer Dome Inc. gained 0.80 to 29.65 on 2.5 million shares, while Bre-X Minerals Ltd. added 0.15 to 19.85 on 2.9 million shares.
