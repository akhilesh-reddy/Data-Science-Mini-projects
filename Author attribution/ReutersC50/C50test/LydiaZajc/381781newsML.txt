Toronto stocks closed flat in light trading on Monday with its upward bias kept in check by battered Barrick Gold Corp. and the fact U.S. markets were closed for a holiday.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index added 3.36 points to end at 6217.60. Turnover was thin at 84.8 million shares worth C$1.13 billion ($836 million).
Investor interest in mergers buoyed Toronto despite tumbles by closely watched Barrick and Bre-X Minerals Ltd., analysts said.
Both fell after Calgary, Alberta-based prospector Bre-X announced a deal with Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc., based in Louisiana, to develop a huge gold discovery in Busang, Indonesia.
Freeport will own 15 percent of Busang, Bre-X will keep 45 percent and Indonesian interests will take 40 percent.
Barrick shares sank sharply after the Toronto-based gold miner was shut out of the Busang development.
"Barrick dragged down the gold index," said Maison Placements Canada president John Ing.
"New York was off today, so there wasn't any action," he added. U.S. financial markets were closed on Monday for President's Day holiday.
Market players will keep an eye on Canada's 1997/98 federal budget due at 1630 EST/2130 GMT on Tuesday, but no major surprises are expected, traders said.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 12 groups rose led by conglomerates, media, forestry products and retail.
The only two weak sectors were gold and financial services.
Advancing issues outpaced declines 545 to 422 with 297 stocks unchanged.
In individual issues, Bre-X fell 0.95 to close at 23.00 on 5.1 million shares, while Barrick sank 1.90 to 34.05 on 1.9 million shares.
Merger mania helped keep Toronto firmer, including oilpatch takeovers.
Energy firm Morrison Petroleums Ltd. rose 0.15 to 10.40, topping Toronto's most active issues. Morrison and Northstar Energy Corp. unveiled a C$700 million ($518 million) merger last week. Northstar shares rose 0.15 to 14.90.
