Toronto stocks ended mixed in light dealings on Monday with weak gold and forestry stocks offsetting strong bank issues and a rally in New York.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index rose 15.57 points to close at 6242.42,  short of its life-time high of 6260.73 reached on February 19.
Declining issues inched ahead of advances 506 to 497, while 277 stocks were unchanged.
Toronto's volume was thin at 95.4 million shares worth C$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion).
New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 76.58 points to close at 7008.20, aided by strength in high-technology stocks.
Toronto's 10 gaining sectors were led by the financial services which rose 48 points.
"It was a blue-chip rally in Canada," said Calgary-based portfolio manager Josef Schachter.
The nation's five biggest banks are scheduled to begin reporting first-quarter earnings this week with Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal on Tuesday.
Bank of Nova Scotia rose 0.65 to close at 51.65, while Bank of Montreal gained 0.50 to finish at 48.40.
Other strong sub-indices included consumer products, pipelines and conglomerates. The four weak groups were gold and precious metals, forestry products, retail and transportation.
Bre-X Minerals Ltd. continued its recent slide, dropping 1.40 to close at 19.80 on almost 3.7 million shares. Analysts attributed part of the decline to Placer Dome Inc.'s comment on Friday that it was no longer interested in bidding for Bre-X after its deal with U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. to develop the rich Busang gold deposit.
Forest products heavyweight MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. topped heavy traders, closing down 0.25 at 19.05 on 7.2 million shares. The stock fell after brokerage Gordon Capital Corp. crossed a seven-million share block earlier in the session.
Telecommunications firm Mitel Corp. dropped 1.40 to 8.45 after announcing that its fourth quarter performance would disappoint analysts.
The company said it expected to take a  C$13 million ($9.6 million) re-tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter to cut operating expenses at its business communications systems unit.
