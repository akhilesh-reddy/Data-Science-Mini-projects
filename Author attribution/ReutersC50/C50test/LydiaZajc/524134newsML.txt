Toronto's stock market ended weaker in thin dealings on Monday, negatively influenced by New York's sell-off.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index fell 28.62 points to 5797.65.
The session was quiet, with 64.8 million shares trading hands worth C$1.02 billion (US$730 million).
"They got a little nervous in New York and the investors ran for the sidelines," said ScotiaMcLeod's senior vice-president Fred Ketchen. "That certainly spilled over into the Canadian market as well."
Wall Street fell as investors reconsidered previous worries of U.S. interest rate hikes.
Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained about five percent last week and Toronto rose nearly 2.5 percent, investors decided to take Wall Street farther down, Ketchen said.
Eleven of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes dropped, led by consumer products, pipelines, conglomerates and retail. The firmer sectors were gold, transportation and forestry products.
In individual issues, copper miner Rio Algom Ltd. slipped 1.80 to close at 34.00 in vigorous trading, surrendering its gains from Friday's rally. The stock soared 3.30 on Friday amid vague takeover rumors.
Biotechnology firm BioChem Pharma Inc. fell 3.35 to 22.40 in light volume.
Canadian high technology issues lost ground in conjunction with their U.S. counterparts. Hummingbird Communications Ltd. lost 2.60 to 31.40 while Cognos Inc. fell 2.05 to 32.30.
Bombardier Inc. shares were up 0.10 to 27.10 in active dealings after ASA Holdings Inc. said it will buy 30 Canadair jets, with options for an additional 60 aircraft.
