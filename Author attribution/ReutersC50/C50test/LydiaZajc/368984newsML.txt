Toronto's key stock index closed higher on Tuesday with a boost from soaring banking issues, but the broader market was pulled lower by weakness in the heavily weighted gold group.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index rose 45.65 points to end at 6126.92. However declining issues edged out advances 515 to 479, while another 300 traded flat.
"The banking sector did well," said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie. Canada's six biggest banks soared to record heights after influential U.S. investment firm Goldman Sachs hiked ratings on five out of the six.
The financial services sector rose more than 1.7 percent.
However, "we've still got a problem in the gold sector," Beattie said. Golds continued to tumble on dropping bullion prices.
Trading was brisk today at 102.9 million valued at C$1.76 billion ($1.3 billion).
Ten of Toronto's 14 sub-indices surged, led by consumer products, banks, conglomerates and oils. The weaker sectors were golds, transportation, forestry products and media.
The hottest stocks were the banks. The Royal Bank of Canada jumped 1.60 to close at 54.85, below its new high of 55.30.
Goldman Sachs put Canada's largest bank on its recommended list, along with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the nation's second biggest. CIBC shares rose 1.25 to end at 66.70, also below a new record of 67.50.
Despite being left out of the upgrades, the Bank of Montreal, the third largest, rose 1.10 to 50.15.
Base and precious metals miner Princeton Mining lost two cents to reach 0.42 on nearly three million shares, topping Toronto's most actives.
It announced a private placement of special warrants at C$0.35 per share, convertible to one common share each, to raise C$5.4 million ($4 million).
