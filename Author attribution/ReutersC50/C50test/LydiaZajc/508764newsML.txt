Toronto stocks closed one percent higher on Tuesday, but trailed a stronger rally in New York as fears of a U.S. interest rate hike eased on weak U.S. inflation numbers.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index soared 64.22 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 5743.55. On Monday, the index was down more than 10 percent since setting its lifetime high of 6348 points on March 11.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 135.26 points to close at 6587.16.

The weaker numbers inspired investors to put aside fears of another U.S. rate move -- at least for a while, Ram said.
Turnover was moderate with volume of 77.1 million shares worth C$1.35 billion ($966 million).
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 11 rose led by banks, conglomerates and utilities. On the weak side, gold fell two percent followed by moderate losses in consumer products and real estate.
