The Toronto stock market edged higher to reach the year's ninth record close in heavy trading on Tuesday, aided by the continued flow of money into tax-sheltered pension funds.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key Composite Index rose 20.62 points to end at 6238.22, which was also a new intraday high.
Turnover was unusually heavy with 138.47 million shares traded worth C$2.52 billion, the TSE's second highest value ever.

In individual issues, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. lost 2.20 to 20.80 on almost 10 million shares while Barrick Gold Corp. shares rose 1.45 to 35.50 on 1.5 million shares.

Under the deal, Bre-X's stake will drop to 45 percent from 90 percent. Freeport will own 15 percent and Indonesian interests will grab 40 percent.
