Toronto stocks extended their winning streak to end higher on Thursday, powered by surging banks as fears of a Canadian interest rate hike eased.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 33.27 points to 6009.90. Trading was heavy at 95.3 million shares worth C$1.7 billion ($1.2 billion).
In the past three sessions, Canada's largest market jumped by more than 2.5 percent.
Banks led 12 of Toronto's 14 sub-indices to higher ground, rising almost 1.8 percent as investors put aside worries that Canada would raise interest rates to match U.S. hikes.
Investment advisor Ira Katzin with RBC Dominion Securities said: "Financial services benefited from the expectations that interest rates would stay stable or ease off a bit."
But market watchers were eying Friday's U.S. employment data, Katzin said.
The numbers could provide more indication of whether U.S. inflation was on the rise, which could prompt rate hikes by U.S. and Canadian central banks.
The U.S. government will report April's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate.
Toronto's stronger sub-sectors included media, pipelines and real estate, while conglomerates and forestry products fell.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 500 to 447 and 301 were flat.
In active issues, gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. lost 0.44 to 3.04 in heavy dealings. Investors continued to consider the worth of its controversial Busang project in Indonesia.
Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's largest bank, rose 1.35 to 57.20 and third-ranked Bank of Montreal also rose 1.35 to 52.05.
