Toronto stocks closed weaker in active trading on Friday as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's cautionary comments about equities continued to weigh on investors' minds.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index lost 29.62 points to finish at 6157.40 points.
Trading volume totalled 101.36 million shares worth C$1.54 billion ($1.12 billion).
"The reverberations of Mr. Greenspan are going on," said portfolio consultant Ron Meisels of Montreal-based P &amp; C Holdings. "Some people are still worried about the fact that he may raise interest rates," he said.
Greenspan warned on Wednesday stock prices may be too high and said he could not rule out a hike in short-term interest rates as a pre-emptive strike against inflationary pressures.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, the seven weak groups included energy, conglomerates, consumer products and utilities.
The six gaining sectors included media, transportation and real estate. Forestry products was unchanged.
Declining issues outnumbered advances 537 to 474. Another 290 stocks were unchanged.
