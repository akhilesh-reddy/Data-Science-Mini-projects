Toronto's stock market soared to the eighth record close of 1997, rallying on the back of high-flying golds and lots of takeover news in Canada's oil patch.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index lept 60.40 points to end at 6225.78. It also set a new intra-day record of 6225.83 points.
"The market finally has made a major break to all-time high levels," said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels.
Turnover was heavy at 122 million shares worth C$2 billion ($1.48 billion).
New York matched Toronto's gains, jumping 60.81 points to end at 7022.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average passed the key 7000 level on optimism about the U.S. economy, low inflation and stable interest rates.
Canada's largest equities market made a strong move upward after surging bullion prices in London boosted heavyweight gold stocks.
Investors also focused on the continuing merger activity in the Western-based oil and gas sector.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices spiralled upward except for real estate. Golds, oils, transportation and consumer products led gaining groups.
Advancing issues raced ahead of decliners 607 to 410 while 269 traded unchanged.
Hot stocks included Morrison Petroleums Ltd., which rose 0.40 to 9.90 before being halted in late trading. It had been the target of a C$652 million ($482 million) hostile takeover by Canadian 88 Energy Corp. but on Thursday announced a merger with Northstar Energy Corp.
Northstar rose 0.35 to 14.15 before the halt while Canadian 88 shares slipped 0.15 to 4.95.
A marriage between Newport Petroleum Corp. and Cimarron Petroleum Ltd. was also announced early on Thursday. Newport shares lost 0.65 to 9.15 while Cimarron soared 3.20 to 23.50.
Talisman Energy Inc. rose 1.10 to 46.25 after unveiling a C$1.7 billion ($1.3 billion) takeover bid for Wascana Energy Inc. late Wednesday night. Wascana shares gained 2.05 to hit 19.00 on nine million shares, which was above the offering price of C$18.50 a share.
