Software maker Cognos Inc sees another strong year in fiscal 1998 and a share buyback or acquisition with its $100 million in cash, Chief Executive Ron Zambonini told Reuters.
"We've had a very strong year," Zambonini said of fiscal 1997 ended February 28. He added in an interview on Monday that 1998 would also be "a big year."
Ottawa-based Cognos makes software to analyze business database information via sophisticated spreadsheets.
"We have six new products and versions coming out in the first quarter," Zambonini said.
Zambonini said that Cognos, whose revenues grew 34 percent to US$51.3 million in the 1997 third quarter ended November 30, was considering how to use its cash hoard of more than US$100 million, he said.
Cognos' net earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 1997 rose to US$23.5 million or US$0.51 a share from year earlier US$10.1 million or US$0.23 a share.
"We think when it's accretive, it makes sense to use our cash," Zambonini said.
"We're actively looking right now for other products," he said. In early February, Cognos said it acquired London-based Right Information Systems Ltd, a business modeling and forecasting software developer, for $8 million in cash and stock.
He added that Cognos planned to expand operations in Europe, especially in Germany, Italy and Scandinavia.
A buyback of up to five percent of shares was another option, since the stock had taken a beating on Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange since late last year, Zambonini said.
Investors sold off after an analyst downgraded Cognos to a hold from a buy, saying the stock reached his target price in early December.
Cognos shares were up 0.20 to 32.75 in Toronto on Tuesday, down from a 52-week high of 53.50. Cognos was unchanged at 24-1/8 on Nasdaq, versus a 52-week high of about 39.
