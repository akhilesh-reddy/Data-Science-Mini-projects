ITT Corp expects the sale of its non-core assets to take up to six months, although the Madison Square Garden properties are likely to be sold more quickly, according to sources close to the company.
The hotel, casino and entertainment company has held high-level talks with Cablevision Systems Corp about acquiring its 50 percent stake in Madison Square Garden, but no deal has been struck, the sources said.
Cablevision is "the primary potential acquirer," said one source close to ITT who declined to be identified.  
Although ITT has held discussions with potential buyers about the other properties, which include its profitable international telephone directories business, those talks are not in advanced stages, the sources said.
Sources also said on Thursday that ITT has hired Morgan Stanley to assist with the asset sales. ITT also is being advised by Lazard Freres and Chase Securities.
ITT declined to comment on the potential sales or the hiring of Morgan Stanely. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman also declined to comment.  
ITT rejected a $6.5 billion hostile takeover bid from Hilton Hotels Corp on Wednesday and said it would consider selling non-core assets to boost shareholder value.
ITT partnered with Cablevision in 1995 to buy the Madison Square Garden properties, which include the world-famous arena, the New York Knicks professional basketball team and the New York Rangers professional hockey team.
Cablevision declined to comment again today, referring to a Wednesday statement in which it said it does not comment on rumored deals and also noted it has a good relationship with ITT.
