Britain's top financial regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) on Thursday launched a 400,000 pound ($654,000) advertising campaign designed to heighten the public's awareness of the review into pensions mis-selling.
Under the banner, "Have You Lost Out On Your Pension?", the campaign seeks to underline the importance of the public playing its part in the review.
The advertisements will be carried in the national press between Thursday and Sunday this week.
The move has been timed to coincide with the mailing of questionnaires by firms to people who have potentially been mis-sold pensions.
"It is vital that investors respond to the questionnaire, even if they are unable to provide all the information asked for. Otherwise, their case cannot be resolved speedily," the SIB said in a statement.
Just two weeks ago regulators moved to speed up compensation payments to victims of pension misselling by banks and insurance companies in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Companies involved have been given an ultimatum to  settle outstanding cases in an effort to speed up the process and complete it by the end of next year.
As many as 1-1/2 million people may have been wrongly advised to take out personal pensions instead of staying in occupational schemes.
A review was launched in 1994 but recent figures show that so far only around 50,000 assessments have been completed out of the 570,000 cases currently for review.
A total 102 million pounds has been paid out in 12,650 cases where redress has been accepted, around 8,000 pounds each. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds) Thursday, 29 May 1997 14:02:56 ENDS  nFLLUIT1AF
