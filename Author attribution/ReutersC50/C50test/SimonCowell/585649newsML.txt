Lloyd's of London is to publish recommendations that the insurance market be externally regulated for the first time in its 300-year history in proposals to be published on Friday.
According to sources at Lloyd's, a working party set up in 1996 to consider market regulation will recommend that it come under the auspices of Britain's top financial watchdog, the Securities and Investments Board (SIB).
As well as recommending external oversight, specific proposals will be put forward on how regulation is organised, the sources said.
Any plans will have to be approved by the new Labour government, but if adopted they would put an end to Lloyd's current system of self-regulation.
The changes would require amendments to the Insurance Companies Acts and the Financial Services Act (1986).
David Gittings, Lloyd's director of regulation, said in January that he would be "surprised" if the review did not recommend some sort of external overview.
The now-ruling Labour party said in the run-up to this month's general election it favoured making regulation accountable to the Department of Trade &amp; Industry (DTI) and SIB rather to the Council of Lloyd's, as at present.
The new government is expected to carry out a thorough review of all financial services regulation in coming months. That is likely to include Lloyd's.
While the DTI currently regulates Lloyd's solvency requirements, it is not subject to external regulation on protection of members' interests or the operation of a transparent market.
A rescue package last year saved Lloyd's from collapse after the huge losses it incurred between 1988 and 1992.
The review of the market's regulation was set in motion last October.
The panel included representatives from other regulatory organisations as well as from Lloyd's. The DTI had a 'watching brief' on the panel and the SIB was represented in addition to members from the regulated financial services community.
