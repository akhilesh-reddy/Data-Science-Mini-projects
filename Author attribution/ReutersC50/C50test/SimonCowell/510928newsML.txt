A vehicle to reinsure so-called 'orphan syndicates' could free thousands of Lloyd's of London Names currently trapped in the insurance market according to plans published on Tuesday.
John Rew, co-founder of publisher and market analyst Chatset, has invited Names - the traditional backers of Lloyd's - to fund a feasibility study on whether a Name-owned company could be floated to re-insure orphan syndicates.
Rew, is seeking to raise 600,000 pounds ($972,000), one third of which will be devoted to the study. If successful, a prospectus will be issued to set up the syndicate.
There are around 13,000 Names trapped on more than 50 syndicates for 1993 which are still open because of the uncertainty surrounding eventual liabilities.
Normally the 1993 year would have closed at the end of 1995. Until they do, none of the Names can formally leave Lloyd's.
In order to close a syndicate, Lloyd's requires that the reinsurance be backed by another syndicate. About five Lloyd's syndicates specialise in this market.
Following huge losses run-up by Lloyd's between 1988 and 1992, members of closed syndicates transferred outstanding liabilities to a specially created reinsurance company, Equitas, under a rescue package implemented last year.
But Equitas did not take on orphan syndicates.
Once orphan syndicates have been reinsured, the names' deposit can be released.
In the case of ceased or resigned Names, who may comprise as many as half the 13,000, Lloyd's requires 100 percent of the 'stamp capacity' to be backed by deposit, which Rew estimates could mean up to 450 million pounds trapped within Lloyd's.
