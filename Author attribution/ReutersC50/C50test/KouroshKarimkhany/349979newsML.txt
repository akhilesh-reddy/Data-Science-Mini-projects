Apple Computer Inc will announce as early as Monday a new round of massive job cuts and a plan to reduce the company's operations to three groups, a person close to the company said on Sunday.
The second restructuring in the 12 months since new Chief Executive Gilbert Amelio took control of the struggling company may include job cuts of up to a quarter of Apple's 13,000 workforce, the Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday.
The restructuring also may include moves to focus Apple's half-a-dozen business units even more on selling computers to the publishing industry and schools, the segments where Apple still holds a market-share lead over competitors, the person close to Apple said.
The fourth-biggest U.S. maker of personal computers has been taking a closer look at unprofitable product lines, such as the Newton handheld computer, with an eye toward discontinuing them.
The latest restructuring would come less than a month after Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported an unexpected fiscal first-quarter loss of $120 million. The loss was a setback to Amelio's three-year plan to staunch Apple's losses by 1996, introduce new products by 1997 and to get the company growing again by 1998.
To meet its goal, Apple has to cut another $400 million in costs this year to break even, Apple executives have said. Last year, Apple laid off 1,500 employees. But as customers avoid buying computers from the troubled company, revenue has declined faster than Apple executives expected.
According to a report released last week by market researcher Dataquest, Apple's U.S. shipments dropped 30 pecent in 1996 while the rest of the industry grew 17.8 percent.
Apple now expects revenue for the current fiscal year, which will end September, to decline by about 20 percent to $8 billion.
Apple is still working on the details of the restructuring plan, Apple sources said. An announcement on Monday would come two days before Apple's annual shareholder meeting at its headquarters.
