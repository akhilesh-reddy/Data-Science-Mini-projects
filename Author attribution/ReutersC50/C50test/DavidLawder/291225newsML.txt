Chrysler Corp. will report record earnings for 1996, based on record worldwide sales of 2.97 million vehicles, company chairman Robert Eaton said Tuesday.
"We're going to have a record year," Eaton said in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show.
Chrysler's previous annual profit record came in 1994, when the company earned $3.713 billion. It earned $2.025 billion in 1995, when sales were held to 2.61 million units by the launch of its current line of minivans.
Eaton also said Chrysler in 1997 should be able to exceed its 1996 sales results because the company will be able to produce about 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than in 1996.
The increase will be come from added capacity for the new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle in Newark, Del., as well as increased assembly line speeds for the Dodge Ram pickup truck in St. Louis, and increased production of Dodge Dakota pickup trucks in Warren, Mich.
Chrysler planned to unveil the Durango at the Detroit auto show later Tuesday.
Eaton said despite sluggish industrywide car sales and the increasing popularity and profitability of light trucks, the automaker has not cut back on investment in future car programmes.
He said, however, that Chrysler may shift its investment plans if trucks continued to gain market share.
"We're going to put the money where the market goes," he said, adding that new, more efficient truck engines should allow Chrysler to continue to increase truck capacity without violating federal fuel economy laws.
Eaton also said Chrysler has tentatively planned to add a third production shift to its Bramalea, Ontario, car assembly plant after it launches production of a new generation of LH family sedans later this year. The LH line includes the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and LHS and Eagle Vision, which also are expected to be introduced at the show.
Chrysler stock dropped 12.5 cents to $35.50 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.
