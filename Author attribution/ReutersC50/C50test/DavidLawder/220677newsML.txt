Chrysler Corp.'s redesigned 1997 Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle will carry a base price $555 to $1,344 higher than the 1996 model, the automaker said Wednesday.
Chrysler, implementing the first major update of the Cherokee since it was introduced by American Motors Corp. in the fall of 1983, said the base SE, two-door, two-wheel-drive 1997 model will start at $15,825, an increase of $555 from the 1996 model.
The four-door, four-wheel-drive Cherokee Sport model -- the most popular version of the vehicle -- will sell for $20,985, an increase of $815 from the 1996 model. The most expensive Cherokee, the four-door, four-wheel-drive Country model, will start at $23,945, an increase of $1,344 over the 1996 model.
The Sport and Country models offer a standard six-cylinder engine, while the SE model offers a standard four-cylinder engine. All of the prices include a $525 destination charge.
For 1997, the vehicle gets a new instrument panel with dual air bags, updated sheet metal and a redesigned grille.
But the Cherokee retains much the same squared-off look it had when it became the industry's first compact, four-door sport utility vehicle as a 1984 model.
Chrysler said it has the capacity to build about 150,000 Cherokees annually at its Toledo, Ohio, assembly plant. Through the first 10 months of 1996, Jeep dealers sold 131,995 Cherokees, which represents a 44 percent increase over the 91,246 they sold in the same period of 1995.
The automaker also said it kept the price of its 1997 Dodge Viper GTS coupe unchanged at $66,700, but two features that were standard the 1996 model -- metallic blue paint with white racing stripes and polished aluminum wheels -- are now options with a combined cost of $1,500. The 1997 Viper GTS coupe comes with standard monochromatic red paint.
Separately, Chrysler increased cash incentives on two 1996-model versions of its full-size vans, effective immediately through April 7, 1997.
Chrysler said the cash rebate on the 1996 Dodge Ram Wagon was increased to $1,500 from $1,200, while the rebate on the 1996 Dodge Ram Van Conversion was raised to $2,000 from $1,600.
