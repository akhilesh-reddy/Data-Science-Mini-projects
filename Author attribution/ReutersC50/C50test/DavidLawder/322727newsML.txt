Chrysler Corp., capping the strongest annual sales performance in its history, said Tuesday it earned $807 million during the fourth quarter of 1996, with special charges holding it back from its best full-year profit ever.
Detroit's No. 3 automaker reported full-year 1996 net income of $3.53 billion, or $4.77 per common share, compared with $2.025 billion, or $2.65 a share, for calendar-year 1995.
Last year's results fell short of Chrysler's 1994 record of $3.71 billion because of $347 million in special charges.
Chrysler said it finished 1996 with 2,450,826 U.S. retail vehicle sales, including fleet sales, which broke the 1988 calendar-year record of 2,208,057.
"One of the highlights of the year was the fact that according to independent data, Chrysler is the only auto manufacturer to beat industry average in both owner loyalty, or repurchase rate, and new customer conquest rate in 1996," Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said.
"That's the best way to grow the company and we did, increasing our combined U.S. and Canadian retail market share by 1.4 percentage points," he added.
The fourth quarter's results, equal to $1.12 a share, compared with profits of $1.04 billion, or $1.35 a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues climbed to $16.2 billion from $15.1 billion.
Chrysler's performance in the latest period included charges totalling $279 million related to the retirement of debt, the write-down of its investment in Pentastar Electronics, lump sum retiree pension costs and a voluntary early retirement programme.
On an operating basis, both the fourth quarter and full year were records for Chrysler.
Excluding the charges, Chrysler earned $1.09 billion in the quarter and $3.88 billion for the year, beating out its previous operating records of $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter of 1994 and $3.58 billion in the full 1994 year.
Chrysler attributed its strong performance to a 10.7 percent increase in worldwide factory vehicle sales, to 2,958,800 from 2,673,539 in 1995.
Based on strong sales of trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans, Chrysler's share of the U.S. and Canadian car and truck market climbed to 16.1 percent for the year from 14.7 percent in 1995.
Eaton said, however, that the company will not rest on its laurels.
"There is no end to the improvements we can achieve if we remain vigilant about controlling our costs and about continually improving our processes and our products," he said in a statement accompanying the results.
"That's the challenge we're all focused on and it's one I'm confident we'll meet."
Chrysler said its employees will share the wealth, with about 79,000 U.S. hourly and salaried workers receiving an average profit-sharing payment of $7,900 in February.
That compares with $3,200 for the company's 1995 performance and $8,000 for the 1994 performance, which was received by about 75,200 employees.
Chrysler's stock rose 62.5 cents to $35.125 in very early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
