Buoyed by strong sales of light trucks, Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, but special charges held the automaker back from its best-ever full-year profit.
Detroit's No. 3 automaker posted net income of $807 million, or $1.12 per share, during the fourth quarter after $279 million in charges. Excluding those charges, Chrysler's operating earnings were a record $1.09 billion, or $1.51 a share. In the fourth quarter of 1995, Chrysler posted profits of $1.04 billion, or $1.33 a share.
Chrysler's full-year 1996 net income came to $3.53 billion, or $4.74 per share, including $347 million in special charges. The total fell short of the company's 1994 all-time record of $3.71 billion.
On a pretax basis, Chrysler earned $6.09 billion for all of 1996, a full-year record that topped 1995's $3.45 billion.
Chrysler, which was fighting for its life five years ago, rewarded its 79,000 U.S. employees handsomely for the 1996 results, saying they will receive average profit-sharing checks of $7,900 in February -- more than double the $3,200 they received last year.
Comerica Bank economist David Littman estimated that the payments to Chrysler's 45,000 workers in Michigan could boost the state's economy by as much as $356 million.
Wall Street also cheered the results. Chrysler's stock rose $1.50 a share to close at $36 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts said shares of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which report results next week, rose in sympathy. GM shares closed up $1.25 at $62, while Ford shares closed up 50 cents at $33.625.
Driving the gains for 1996 was a 10.7 percent increase in worldwide factory vehicle sales, to 2.96 million from 2.67 million in 1995. Strong sales of trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans, pushed Chrysler's 1996 share of the U.S. and Canadian car and truck market to 16.1 percent from 14.7 percent in 1995.
"There is no end to the improvements we can achieve if we remain vigilant about controlling our costs and about continually improving our processes and our products," Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement. "That's the challenge we're all focused on and its one I'm confident we'll meet."
During the fourth quarter, Chrysler's profit was reduced by $279 million in charges that covered the early retirement of debt; higher United Auto Workers pension costs; a voluntary early retirement program; and the write-down of Chrysler's investment in Pentastar Electronics, a defence subsidiary sold to a Huntsville, Ala., investor group for $17 million.
Excluding the charges, Chrysler earned $1.09 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.88 billion for the year, beating two-year-old records for operating results.
John Casesa, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim, said a strong mix of high-profit vehicles, such as minivans and Dodge Ram pickup trucks, led to an increase of in the company's profit margin to 22.3 percent from 20.8 percent.
Chrysler's fourth quarter profit per vehicle -- viewed as the envy of the industry -- rose $60 from a year earlier to $1,331, but fell short of the company's record level of $1,350 in the fourth quarter of 1994.
"It was a good quarter, but I don't think it was a great quarter," said PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward. "They are not at their peak operating margin."
Ward and other analysts said the margin pressure was due to an increase in U.S. incentives per vehicle to $660 from $495 in 1995 and $410 in 1994. Increased spending on new products and overseas expansion, as well as higher labour and pension costs, also helped to eat into margins.
Still, Chrysler is "hitting on all cylinders, and they're sold out," noted Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.analyst Ron Glantz.
Eaton told reporters in a conference call that Chrysler's financial position was so strong it might not need to dip into its approximately $7 billion cash reserve to fund operations and stay profitable during the next industry downturn.
"That would allow us to use a significant portion of our cash reserves for growth opportunities that might just occur during such a downturn," Eaton said.
