Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday profits jumped 82 percent to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as it rebounded from product launches that held profits down a year earlier.
Ford, the last of the Big Three Detroit automakers to report fourth-quarter results, said the earnings equalled $1 a share. The results reflected a total of $132 million in special charges, including costs related to Ford's decision to cut 3,500 jobs last year.
In the 1995 quarter, Ford earned $660 million, or 49 cents a share. Sales rose to $38.8 billion from $34.6 billion.
Excluding one-time items, Ford's fourth quarter income was $1.10 a share -- higher than the $1.02 a share forecast by analysts, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.
Although Ford appears to be making headway in cost reduction, analysts were not overly impressed, noting that sales of high-profit light truck products are booming.
"They were not great, especially in view of the fact that they are selling a lot trucks," said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz &amp; Co.
Ford Chairman Alex Trotman said in a statement that automotive earnings will improve in 1997, because the company has successfully completed its highest-volume launches in North America and Europe.
"We're starting 1997 in a much stronger competitive position," he said.
Trotman said Ford expects better results for all of 1997 in Europe, where the company is moving to cut costs. Ford also predicted smaller losses in South America for 1997, he added.
"Overall, we are on track," he said.
Meantime, Ford Chief Financial Officer John Devine told reporters that cost-cutting will reach new heights in 1997. For the first time, Ford expects 1997 costs to be below those of the prior year.
The fourth quarter results capped a mixed year for the automaker in which strong profits from its Financial Services Group were needed to offset a steady flow of red ink from overseas operations.
Earnings for all of 1996 rose 7 percent to $4.4 billion, or $3.65 a share, from $4.1 billion, or $3.34 in 1995. Ford's worldwide automotive operations posted net income of $1.6 billion, down from $2 billion. Financial Services earned a record $2.8 billion in 1996, up 33 percent over 1995.
Revenues for the year climbed to $147.0 billion from $137.1 billion in 1995.
Ford's core U.S. automotive operations, which contribute about 65 percent of total automotive revenues, reported profits of $628 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $168 million a year ago.
Ford continued to have problems overseas, but there were signs of progress in turning those operations around. Ford's European loss for the quarter rose to $88 million from $48 million. But excluding $127 million in severance charges in the 1996 quarter, the operating results showed a $39 million profit, versus a $26 million operating profit last year.
In South America, where Ford has struggled in the Brazilian market, the fourth quarter net loss was $287 million, compared with a $112 million loss a year ago.
"I thought the fourth quarter was an okay quarter. What was most important was improvement on the cost front," said Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.
On Tuesday, General Motors Corp. said strike costs slashed fourth quarter earnings by 50 percent to $786 million. Chrysler Corp. last week said fourth quarter earnings fell to $807 million, down from $1.04 billion.
Ford's stock lost 12.5 cents to close at 32.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
