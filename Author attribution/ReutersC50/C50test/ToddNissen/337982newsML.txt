General Motors Corp. said Tuesday its fourth quarter earnings fell by more than half as labour strife in the second half of the year cost it $700 million in profits.
The world's largest automaker earned $786 million, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $1.59 billion, or $1.95 a share, in the 1995 fourth quarter. All figures exclude results from Electronic Data Systems Corp., which was spun off last June.
Revenues fell to $40.95 billion from $41.35 billion.
For all of 1996, GM earned $4.95 billion, or $6.06 a share, down from $6.03 billion, or $7.14 a share. Revenues for the year rose to $164.1 billion from $160.3 billion.
Workers from the United Auto Workers union and Canadian Auto Workers union struck GM last fall after talks broke down on a new three-year contract. In March 1996, a UAW strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants crippled GM's North American production for more than two weeks.
All told, GM said work stoppages in the United States and Canada reduced its full-year earnings by $1.2 billion on an after-tax basis.
"Clearly our 1996 fourth-quarter and calendar-year results were impacted by the strike-related production losses in the United States and Canada and are not indicative of GM's potential for continued profit improvement," GM Chairman John Smith said.
The strikes also took a bite out of the 1996 profit sharing checks for GM's union workers. GM said 282,000 represented workers in the United States will receive about $300 each -- less than half of the $800 each received last year.
GM said 76,000 eligible salaried workers will receive 1996 incentive payments, with payments rising with the level of pay and responsibility. By comparison, Chrysler Corp. announced last week its U.S. workers will each receive an average of $7,900 in profit sharing.
GM's 1996 fourth quarter results included several one-time accounting items, including a $157 million loss on the sale of four Delphi parts plants to Peregrine Inc. and a $167 million charge for lump sum payments to UAW members as part of its new labour contract.
Including the strike-related effects, the one-time items brought down GM's fourth quarter earnings by $762 million, or 99 cents a share. However, the fourth quarter also included a separate, favourable tax gain of $262 million.
GM's North American operations, its core automotive group in the United States, had a net loss of $124 million vs. a profit of $603 million in the year-ago quarter. For the year, the North American unit, which includes Delphi Automotive Systems, earned $1.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion.
The automaker's international operations reported net income of $353 million for the quarter, down from $498 million a year ago. For all of 1996, GM's international profits were $1.5 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 1995.
Worldwide car and truck deliveries from GM dealers for the quarter were 1.9 million units vs. 2.02 million a year earlier. That reduced the automaker's worldwide market share to 15.5 percent for the quarter from 17.3 percent.
GM's U.S. market share also fell, to 30.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 33.5 percent a year ago. Unit deliveries in the United States were 1.08 million down from 1.20 million.
In his statement, Smith also blamed the lower 1996 results on production changeovers, higher advertising and "consumer-influence" expenses related to new-product launches. The average U.S. retail incentive for the fourth quarter was $739 a vehicle, up from $518.
"We have more new cars and trucks going into the market now than any time in the last 15 years," he said. "In fact, about 20 percent of the 1997 production will be for the new models launched in 1996. Those new cars and trucks are key to our plans to aggressively increase market share in the United States this year."
GM stock was down $1 at $60.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
