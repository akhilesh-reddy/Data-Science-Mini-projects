The Budapest Stock Exchange hit a record high on Friday, leading a foreign-buying induced bull run through eastern Europe this week.
Markets across the region rose, led by Budapest and Warsaw, which recorded a year-high. Romania and Slovenia also moved strongly higher, while Bratislava and Prague edged up with little upward momentum.
WARSAW
The Warsaw Stock Exchange set four consecutive 33-month highs in heavy turnover this week and post-fixing buying on Friday was seen pushing them to another highs next week. Analysts said a profit-taking correction was likely later.
The bourse has risen 25 percent since December 10.
"...I think next week investors will start taking profits after such a surge," said Maciej Matusiak, an analyst at PKO BP brokerage. Analysts expected 16,000 points to provide strong support for the WIG index next week.
Some analysts said the profit-taking correction was likely to be brief and the market could return to its uptrend later on, possibly on growing foreign interest in Polish stocks, which were luring new investors.
BUDAPEST
The Budapest bourse continued its bull run this week, setting record highs in the four of the week's five sessions.
Propelled primarily by oil and gas company MOL shares, the BUX index wiped out Thursday's half percent fall, finishing the week at a record high of 5,438.35 points, up 405.49 points or 8.05 percent.
Traders said they still believe the market must endure a correction after gains of around 30 percent so far this year, but they are convinced any new downturn will be limited.
"After substantial rises, a natural correction could come but no major fall should be expected," Laszlo Baranyai of Gog Securities said. "We might move a little lower next week."
With little fresh news on the macroeconomic side, preliminary annual corporate results, to be published by February 15 could give clues to the future direction, traders said.
PRAGUE
The Prague Stock Exchange edged up this week in moderate trading. Analysts said investors have been heartened by recent talk of strengthening market oversight but it may take several months before strong flows of money return.
The PX50 index closed on Friday at 557.5, up 0.1 points, on the week. "We're still seeing a lot of interest in funds, but some of the other major shares are flat," said Alex Angell of Wood and Company.
Several funds have attracted heavy investor interest after declaring they would transform their closed-ended unit trusts into open-ended funds, making it possible that the shares would rise much closer to their net asset value.
The Finance Ministry is still creating guidelines for the funds, but at least one fund manager, Harvard, has said it plans to begin buying units from current holders in anticipation that it would receive approval to transform.
BRATISLAVA
The Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) edged higher in a quiet week, and brokers said the market was stabilising after a slow start to the year.
But they said the growth was still fragile due to generally weak investor interest. "There is constant demand for only a few issues, which could stop virtually any time," said Peter Lachkovic of Slovenska Sporitelna.
The 12-share SAX index rose mainly on gains to oil refiner Slovnaft, closing at 187.42 points on Friday, up 1.85 from Monday's open at 185.57.
ZAGREB
Croatian stocks were firmer with blue chips posting new records on Friday, and seen as extending their strong gains next week.
Traders said drug firm Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka -- closing at 513 and 1,870 kuna respectively -- would continue to pull the market up. But investor interest was expected to turn increasingly to hotel issues and food stocks such as Podravka, which topped its issued 300-kuna price to end at 305 kuna.
BUCHAREST
The bulk of Bucharest prices jogged higher this week as bullish sentiment which has gripped the market since the start of the year pushed stocks higher for the sixth consecutive session, sending the two indices to year-highs.
Analysts said the bull run has been fuelled by higher 1996 inflation and a depreciating leu.
LJUBLJANA
Slovenian shares jumped 11.8 percent this week, pushed up by foreign buying. The 10-share SBI index soared 156.6 points to 1,479.4.
