Britain's Bass plc has added to its already substantial holdings in the Czech Republic by increasing its stake in brewer Pivovar Radegast a.s..
Radegast Director Jan Sikora told Reuters on Tuesday that Bass had raised its stake in the company -- one of the "Big Four" Czech brewers -- by about 10 percent to 30.07 percent, but would not say from whom the stake had been purchased.
The Czech news agency CTK, quoting unnamed sources, reported earlier that Bass had bought 9.97 percent of Radegast from Raiffeisen Capital and Investment Praha.
But Raiffeisen and Bass officials would not confirm the report and Sikora would not disclose any further details.
The Prague-based bank Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. is Radegast's largest shareholder with a 34 percent stake while a fund managed by the investment arm of Czech insurer Ceska Pojistovna a.s. holds 30 percent.
In July, Bass took an initial 20 percent stake in Radegast, augmenting Bass's Czech portfolio which includes a majority holding in Prague Breweries (Prazske Pivovary) and two smaller provincial beer makers.
Since buying shares in 1993 in Prague Breweries, makers of the flagship lager Staropramen, Bass has aggressively marketed Czech beer abroad and especially in Britain.
Radegast, which brews a popular lager with the same name and which was a major sponsor of the Czech national football team in the European championships last year, is based near the northeastern city of Ostrava.
In the first nine months of 1996, it posted a gross profit of 281.5 million crowns ($10.35 million), up from 230 million for the same period in 1995. ($1=27.19 Czech Crown)
