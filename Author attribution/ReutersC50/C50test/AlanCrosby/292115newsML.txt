Britain's Bass plc has added to its already substantial holdings in the Czech Republic by increasing its stake in the northeastern brewer Pivovar Radegast a.s..
Radegast Director Jan Sikora told Reuters on Tuesday that Bass had raised its stake in the Czech firm by about 10 percent to 30.07 percent, but would not say from whom the stake was purchased.
The CTK news agency, quoting unnamed sources, reported earlier on Tuesday that Bass had purchased 9.97 percent of Radegast from Raiffeisen Capital and Investment Praha.
But Raiffeisen and Bass officials said they were unable to confirm the report. Sikora would not disclose any further details of the sale.
The Prague-based bank Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. is Radegast's largest shareholder with a 34 percent stake while a fund managed by the investment arm of the Czech insurer Ceska Pojistovna, holds 30 percent.
In July, Bass took an initial 20 percent stake in Radegast, one of the country's four largest brewers, augmenting Bass's Czech portfolio which includes a majority stake in the Prague Breweries (Prazske Pivovary) and two smaller provincial brew houses.
Since acquiring shares in the Prague Breweries, makers of the flagship lager Staropramen, in 1993, Bass has moved agressively to market Czech beer, namely Staropramen, abroad and especially in Britain.
Bass has said it hopes to integrate their Czech operations with the other breweries which have merged with the Prague plant.
Radegast, which brews a popular lager with the same name and which was a major sponsor of the Czech national football team in the European championship, is based near the northeastern city of Ostrava.
Over the first nine months of 1996, the firm posted a gross profit of some 281.5 million crowns, up from 230 million for the same period in 1995.
