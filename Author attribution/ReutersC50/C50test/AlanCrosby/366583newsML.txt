The Prague Stock Exchange slipped on Monday from last week's year high on a round of profit taking, but analysts said sentiment remains bullish for the coming weeks.
After a strong rise last week, market heavyweights SPT Telecom, CEZ and Komercni Banka, which together account for almost half of the PX50 index, all fell to drag the index down 0.77 percent to 595.1 points.
"The market has corrected a little bit, but there seems to be good support at this level," Marco Anderegg of Patria Finance told Reuters.
"Foreign investor interest remains solid and towards the end of last week broader issues were gaining interest so it looks solid for a lot of the market," he added.
SPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, closed down 75 crowns at 3,700, while power company CEZ, which accounts for 14 percent, was off 28 crowns to 1,202 and commercial bank Komercni (11 percent) lost 25 crowns to 2,620.
"We saw some of the blue chips such as Komercni and SPT rebound in late deals, which could show that the market's weakness will be short-lived. I expect to see prices begin rising again soon," said one local trader.
The PSE has been climbing steadily since a slump in the fourth quarter 1996 took 25 percent off the index. Analysts blamed a lack of government commitment to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency for the dive.
The index has gained nearly 10 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors.
Bram Buring of Brno Broker Group said the correction could last for several weeks as lower than expected company results began to flood in, possibly taking as much as five percent from the index before it rebounds.
But he added: "Foreign investors are definitely interested and kick starting the market...We expect that to continue but things have overheated a little at the moment."
Analysts added that the recent strong performance of the crown should also boost the equities market since investors are shielded from wide currency fluctuations.
The crown has gained over three percent against its dollar/mark basket since the beginning of the year, and analysts have predicted it will hold its value or strengthen further in the coming weeks.
In late afternoon trading on Monday it was holding steady at 5.32 percent above its basket mid-point, up slightly from the central bank's daily fixing at 5.28 percent over the mid-point. The crown was fixed on Friday at 5.23 percent above the mid-point.
