Czech consumer prices rose by what some analysts considered a surprisingly low 0.2 percent in August, after 1.0 percent in July, to put prices 9.6 percent up on the same month in 1995.
The result surprised analysts although it kept average inflation well over the government's 1996 target of eight percent.
Radek Maly, an economist with Citibank in Prague, said: "It is very low, I expected the month-on month inflation to be over 0.6 percent, and the year-on-year figure to get over ten percent."
The Statistical Bureau (CSU) said a hike in regulated natural gas and power prices sparked a 3.2 percent month-on-month increase in housing prices, the main impetus for August inflation.
Food, beverages and tobacco products actually showed a price drop in August of 1.4 percent, thanks to a 29.5 percent fall in potato prices and 25.9 percent decrease of vegetables.
"What was totally surprising to me was the fall in the foods index, and considering its (large) weighting, it obviously pulled the whole figure down. The whole structure looks very well," Maly said.
The CSU in July raised its average inflation forecast for the whole year to 9.0 percent, and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the cabinet based its 1997 budget calculations on an inflation expectation of "not below" eight percent.
Klaus did not specify if he meant the year-on-year or the moving average rate.
Maly said the August result might help the 1996 figure to finish below nine percent, but nowhere near the government's earlier target.
The government has said it would aim to cut inflation by one percentage point every year after 1995's rate of nine percent.
