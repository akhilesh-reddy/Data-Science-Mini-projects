Strippers can dance naked in Canada as long as they keep their distance from the customers.
Exotic dancers on Thursday cheered a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that bans lap dancing, but club owners warned it would turn off customers and put some establishments out of business.
"I think it's great. Dancing is for seeing, not touching," said a dancer at Filmores, a well-known Toronto strip club.
Canada's top court ruled on Wednesday that lap dancing -- sitting naked on a customer's lap and rubbing against him -- was indecent and a criminal act.
Andy, a lunchtime patron at the Zanzibar strip club on Toronto's seedy Yonge Street, said the court ban was unnecessary.
"The only thing criminal about it is if prostitution is involved. Some girls just take it too far," said the apprentice electrician as a dancer gyrated on the stage behind him.
Canada's lap-dance brouhaha began in 1994 when an Ontario judge ruled that a variety of sexual acts at a Toronto strip club did not offend community standards.
After the ruling, lap dancing quickly spread to other clubs across the country.
A former stripper, Katharine Goldberg, led a public crusade against lap dancing, arguing that some dancers were forced by club owners to masturbate customers and perform other acts.
"This should end the suffering of so many young women and protect the health and lives of many people," Goldberg said.
But Canadian newspapers have quoted other strippers who resented Goldberg's potrayal of them as sex slaves. Most customers obeyed the no-touch rule and it was more lucrative than table dancing, they said.
A lap dance can cost up to $20 each with some dancers taking home between $300 and $500 a night.
The Supreme Court upheld an appeal court decision that overturned the original 1994 court ruling. The appeals judge said lap dancing degraded dancers and encouraged clients to treat women as sexual objects.
