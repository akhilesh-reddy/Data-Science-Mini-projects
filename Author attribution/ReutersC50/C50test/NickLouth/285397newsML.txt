LCI International Inc said on Friday it expected to post a 75 to 80 percent increase in operating earnings in 1996 and a 65 percent increase in revenue.
Brian Thompson, chief executive of the long-distance company, said he never told analysts to expect lower growth from the company. He said he was standing by his long-term forecast of 30 to 40 percent annual revenue growth.
"I told them I never changed that (forecast)," Thompson told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said he expected the company to put in a strong performance in 1997, too.  
LCI's stock plunged in December after conversations with analysts were interpreted as indicating slower revenue growth. Thompson said he was unable initially to correct the impression because the company was in a quiet period.
"I didn't say we were going to drop in the future. As it turns out, the company will do very well this year (just finished)," he said.
"I think we will end up around 65 percent (in revenues) for the year. Operating earnings are going to be up even more than that -- they are going to be closer to 75 or 80 percent," Thompson said.
