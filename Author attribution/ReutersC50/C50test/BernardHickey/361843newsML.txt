Global media group News Corp Ltd told analysts in a telephone briefing on Thursday that it still expected 20 percent profit growth for the 1996/97 year, despite a below-expectations first half profit result, analysts said.
"They did say that they're still on track for the 20 percent growth," one senior Sydney media analyst said after the morning teleconference briefing between company officials and U.S. and Australian analysts.  
Another senior media analyst, who also asked not to be named, said News had repeated its August 1996 forecast of 20 percent profit growth in the teleconference.
"Yes. They've got no worries about reaching that one," the analyst said.
Earlier on Thursday, News Corp posted a A$731 million net profit before abnormals for the six months to December 31, up 10.3 percent on the same period a year earlier.
But this was below analysts expectations of a pre-abnormals net profit for the half of A$735 million to A$775 million.
